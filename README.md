# What Social Media Platform is This?

This repository holds the data and code for Team OSU Math's submission for the ErdÅ‘s institute's Spring 2023 Data Science Bootcamp.

## Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

Cleaning and EDA for each data source is performed in the instagram_data, reddit_data, sentiment140-twitter_data, twitter_stream, and youtube_data folders. The data sources are synthesized and features are computed in the full_data folder. The data is down-sampled to give balanced class labels in the max72k_data.


## Training Models

Logistic regression models are trained in the logistic_regression folder, while decision trees and random forests are trained in the tree-forest folder.
