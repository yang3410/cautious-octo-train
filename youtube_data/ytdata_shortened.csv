the sriracha king is back babyyyyyy
"🤣🤣🤣 my food tarot cards lead me here, they recommended sriracha and ice cream! I didn't want to try it myself,  but I thought, why not search if there is some crazy person out there who thought of trying this out! And that's how I found you! Thanks for jumping in and sacrifice your taste buds for all of us! 😅❤️‍🔥"
Great concept! Make more! Also would be more interesting if you put a reasonable amount on. Try it on a pear.
when is it 2 coming out
My favorite youtube channel
It's Girl Scout Cookie time! Time add some kick to that sweetness.
How much for the spices and do I have to pay for shipping
"Man, I'm thinking of all that money thrown onto the table  every which way. Were they just discarded between takes?"
Need to reinforce that table.
This is the series that got me into Epicurious. I'd love to see it come back.
This dude is so hands on compared to other experts in this series omg
Smarty pants
Man spilled more than he ate
"Expert that calls rhizomes ""roots"", lol."
Did they ever get an anwer wrong in these series?😂😂
His hair looks like star anise
"Even this guy agrees
Size doesn't matter"
haha peasents. we indians easily get the higher quality spices at lowest prices. at least one thing we are privilidged at.
"Dude's like ... F! your table during every shoot lol. The clean up after him, Must have sucked"
Lol I’m cracking up picturing him finishing the grind and say now for the cinnamon challenge as he grabs a spoonful !
"If somebody uses turmeric as a colouring it means their turmeric is old and needs replacing. Ground turmeric when fresh, though it doesn’t beat its raw form, has a great aroma!"
"This guy really wanted to not let anything untouched for later use



PS: I have a duck video, a chicken video, a video where i am begging for money on Twitter, a walking video... Also a patreon"
"Pine tree, citrus, bourbon what?





PS: I have a duck video, a chicken video, a video where i am begging for money on Twitter, a walking video... Also a patreon"
I can definitely smell the turmeric while watching
Wish they add saffron in the test
"Wow, they really white washed Akira Hayama, from Shokugeki no Soma, for the real life adaptation…..respect ✌️"
His voice sounds like Scott Disick 😂
He sounds like David Mantranga
Least favorite expert of the cleaning lady.
"For a ""spice expert"" the entirety of the first segment as a whole was completely redundant; unless cinnamon-A (cassia) smelled like sawdust, Cinnamon-B (actual cinnamon) was always going to be more expensive. A spice expert would know that before tasting handfuls."
"Cinnamon, B more expensive, knew that direct when I saw A was not real cinnamon, but Cassia.
Tumarik, I buy fresh, the root, looks like a small kind of Ginger.
Paprika, smoked and natural are two different products. You can't really compare.
What keeps amazing me is the prices in the US of produce, I have watched the Cheese, the Charcuterie, and now the spice video's. Wow, I am happy to live in Europe."
Boycott Penzeys spice- according to their CEO all Republicans are racists. Terrible!
"As much as I love spices, this could never be my favorite job as I can never really just chew on them and the moment he does that my mouth feels weird!"
Wouldnt they have to declare any additives like flour or dye added on the packaging label?
"Wait you DON'T want the cinnamon flavour to hit you when making savoury dishes?
One of us is doing this wrong mate 😂

(Actually no, I guess most people agree with him and Im cooking food I like so we are both doing it right!)"
Next episode: The cleaning expert
How in a heck do you become a spice expert? Do you need a bachelor or something?
cinnamon is literally wood lmao
I hate how he handles those spices
Went to make masala chai because he's using an ikea mortar similar as mine
He do by cute looking
Was the sneezing edited out from sniff testing the black peppers?
He is really cute ..... hard to focus on  the spices
Here's the expert you've been looking as an exception to experts looking like the experts of their field.
2 million views?
"Now I need to figure out where you can actually buy other than the same brand bottle of spice from the market. I suppose with spices it's a lot about ""this is very fragrant and tasty"" and ""this is meh"" when it's cheap and expensive spice. Like old stale coffee versus fresh coffee."
with the snob in question the difference isnt just picking some stuff its also finding where you can buy the stuff.
This dude just gets in there… I like it
The more of these I watch the more upset I become realising how true 'you get what you pay for' is
Today I learned that I'm Cumin A
I volunteer to be the Weed expert!
This video very wired bc he is white man 😅
Do you give training because I would really like to learn more about spicy
Why is there such a profession
can't watch this with this guys ugly hands.. ehhh thank god he's not a cook
"Who came up with the name CUMin
😑"
"whats next, a water expert"
I wish they had given this guy a spoon or something so he isn't always making such a huge mess.
"Whatever you say, Spice Harlow"
"“smells kinda fruity.” im fruity too, what about you daddy🤪"
he can probably cook really well🥰
*akira hayama has entered the chat*
Buy your paprika in an opaque container like a tin and an indication of quality is the color … And he sees no problem with this statement. Can you imagine some idiot opening up paprika tins in a grocery store to see the color good lord🤦🏻‍♀️.
This dude literally wasted a sh!^ ton of spices and money
He sounds like Howie Mandel
not really....
💀
Soy boy...
I have an urge to sneeze just watching this.
"his hands still have turmeric on them when he picks up the other.
who am i kidding? all of these ""experts"" are just connected people who can't cook"
HES STILL GOT TURMERIC A ON HIS HANDS DURING THE BLACK PEPPER TEST
I almost want a video solely about all types of pepper.
"Hey Mr Spice expert, before you go saying that a pepper's heat is in the seeds you should verify your information. The capsaicin is stored in the placenta and membranes on ridge or spine that runs the length of the pepper. The seeds come in contact with the capsaicin  simply because of proximity to the source but that's all the heat they contribute. This why the seed heavy selection was not as hot as the one with more pepper flesh, even though it was guessed that it would be. It's a common myth that exists because seeds are attached to the placenta and that is where the heat resides partially. Just food for thought. Enjoyable video either way."
just having 2 or 3 of those will kill me
I couldn't stop thinking about how funny it would be if he snorted the spices to see the quality
real life hayama from food wars
Alternate title: klaus baudelaire explaining spices
Not klaus baudeliare explain spices..
Cinnamon b is better for tea. The other one tastes like perfume.
I've watched a few of these videos where experts have to try to guess which meats or wines or whatever is more expensive and they all have the same problem:  the expert can see what they're tasting.  Expensive meats look VASTLY different from cheap meats.  Expensive spices often have visual clues that tell you whether or not they're high quality.  Blindfold all of these people and then have them guess.
He makes the biggest mess in his process and i love it
I would hate to see this guy's kitchen after he cooks dinner
Best Ceylon Spices - https://www.ebay.com/itm/124435204447
He kind of reminds me of Mark from Ugly Betty. Not complaining tho...
"For the black pepper: if you want more outer surface than volumetric area, wouldnt smaller peppercorns be better for that..?"
"came here looking for a saffron comparison, didn't find it :c 

Nice video anyway, the guy knows his spice."
I know it’s not... but everything he says sounds fake
"as advice never spill turmeric on your counter top , it stains and annoyance to get out ."
"These ""experts"" are getting lamer and lamer. What's next a water expert? Better yet a salted butter expert from a single county of Wisconsin ? Stick with real experts judging thing that require an expert to explain the difference like the cheese expert or the bacon expert."
"Guys Ethan started his own spice company, it's called something and Barrel"
Where are the ones that on every video say “I could have guess which one was more expensive at just a glance”?
I like that I cant tell which is more expensive just by looking 😅
Neutral chaotic energy for sure.
His body language and mannerisms make him look like he doesn't know what he is talking about and yet he knows exactly what he's talking about.
He's cute especially with those curls 😍
Price Points is my favorite sports anime
"People behind the scenes : ""I ain't cleaning that"""
Drug expert(drug addict) guesses between legal and illegal drugs
I'd definitely want to smoke cinnamon after this video
Who's here after the new Dune trailer?
He MUST be an Aries.
Cinnamon challenge winner 2019.
Hayama Akira
"Should have done Turmeric last, Mr Yellow Fingers.. and didn't toast the peppercorns, sheesh.."
Was it just me or was anyone wondering why he didn’t try salt??...
Gnaws on cinnamon stick 👁👄👁
The background look really nice
"As an asian, i bet my mom and grandma is a better expert lol"
"His eyes aren't blue in blue, his skin was never burned by the scorching sun of Arrakis and I doubt he can see beyond time...Not an Spice expert."
5:20  Yellow: Am I joke to you?
17th and 18th century Spaniards would go crazy how he's handling spices
I’ll be the first to say props to who ever does the background for these things must take forever and they’re different every time
A honey expert would be so cool!
Hot damn 😂
He is so messy with the spices lol
Give this man a spoon.
spice expert is a white dude
drop the spice grinder link
Wow...as a person who makes South Indian food this is great knowledge! Thanks
Could I make the word pretentious into video form? Nah. But this channel never ceases to make it happen..
I was so stressed when he threw the turmeric on  the white table 🤣 That stuff stains!!
7:33 😏😏
He reminds me of Crazy Russian Hacker. I really don't know why.
just watching this video gave me allergies
"Oh god, the amount of mess he's making on the table through the whole video 😱"
All of them is fckin expensive. Now i know why they're destroying half of the world to get spices.
The spice must flow
"No offence but...
I want expecting a white expert lol😳😂"
never thought i'd get here.
Did the person who draws the chalkboard in the back get a raise already? Their art is amazing
He should have been allowed to wash the turmeric off his hands before going on to the next spice since turmeric stains
He just stuck his finger in the jar
"I am very confused why white people call pepper spicy, that sensation isnt even similiar"
13:35 why would you use a pestle upside down ? 😩😫
Now let’s taste the cinnamons...ah yes it tastes like cinnamon
whoa. 👏🏼👏🏼
Did anyone else see him just completely flinch out while smelling Pepper A? 🤣
I could just tell by seeing it..😂😂😂
"I'm an Indian, spices are in our genes, and I can tell this guy means business, real deal, great 🙂"
7:32 Guys and girls take notes. It's not only spice this message is forwarded to
I got 5 /6 😅
He is an Indian by soul encapsulated in white body !
lol he was just guessing and you dumbfucks think he is an expert?
This man knows his stuff but wow is he unnecessarily messy
"A: This is dusty, chalky, no color, flavor or taste.

B: Floral, citrusy, spicy, nice aroma, complex... 


Let’s try and see which one is more expensive! 😃"
What make and model is that grinder?
"This guy needs to learn the difference between ""five times more expensive"" (which means the same thing as six times as expensive) and ""five times as expensive"" (which means the same thing as four times more expensive)."
snort some cinnamon
i want that grinder
"Sadly, didn’t mention the country of origin for Cinnamon B 👎🏽"
Where can I get that spice grinder
I love the way the star anise looks like a flower in his hair lol
He’s so cute. When he said “ahhh” when he had a handful of cinnamon is so endearing. Is he single? Jk haha
For someone who doesn’t use them he knows a lot about spices
How does one become a spice expert? 😂😂😂
how does one go about becoming a spice expert?
dude is petshop boys singer
I feel validated for buying expensive spices
I can smell the cinnamon
This man just did the cinnamon challenge with no hesitation 😳
"People have probably talked about this in the comments before, but I’m always impressed and amazed by the blackboard art in the back"
How do you find these very niche experts?!?!
"""Let's try tasting them."" Puts cinnamon in mouth ""So, you get cinnamon."""
He wastes so much of the spices he is trying!!!
Yes the difference is discernable.
“Size doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better product” i’m stealing that
“I know this cinnamon would be the more expensive one because this bark is less common”  I love how he assumes our bark knowledge
"His last name literally means ""fresh"" in German. What a good fit to his job 😅"
he is the only one who might survive the cinnamon challenge
I only want to know what blender that is...
I’m high
"A time lapse of the chalkboard art being made would made a great intro, just saying"
This entertained me so much. Ahhhh He’s humble and actually knew what he was talking about
Boring
"""Hmmyesss. This spice is very spicy"""
yeah he look like an expert on doing spice
"Epicurious: Cinnamon, which is more expensive?

Me: laughs in mexican"
He looked like some kind of spice junkie when he was talking about paprika.
"""I like to shake it around a little bit; makes it easier to smell"" is something I would not mind Ethan Frisch saying to me."
"I think it was really cool how he explained that the other cinnamon is more expensive because it's rare compared to the other type. But neither is ""better"" - they just work best in different dishes."
Ceylon cinnamon is only grown in srilanka. Cinnamon originated from Sri Lanka.
I just love how his fingers stay yellow forever after the turmeric.
Gahd I’d much rather be studying than watching this man talk... he knows his stuff though
There are so many spices I would love  part two of this one. I would like to see what he has to say about curry powder
"Bro I hope this guy cleaned up his own mess. If I was the producer or whatever, I would be like bruh you're not leaving till you do"
he is soooo messy
"This dudes kitchen is probably a mess, but you know he can cook."
"Jonny Khan I don’t think a spice expert would want to do curry powder. Would make their own, soooo much better made fresh every t8me"
"What's with all the experts? 
Need a expert on experts, guessing cheep vs expensive experts."
"6:13, 9:42."
I keep all my paprika in the fridge to help keep the red color.
What spice grinder is that? I need one that can just demolish cinnamon like it's nothing.
"I love spices ! I think I have about 55 different spices in my cupboard  ! I even grind my own spices and spice mixes for specific dishes !  Light is the worse thing yo hit your spices and moisture ! I keep most of my spices in glass !  Really spice makes 3 everything taste better ! But my family do not like their food with anything more than salt!  Then they complain the food taste like paper ! So I lightly spice the food when cooking ! Also spice the oil while it heats up with some dishes ! Like fresh spices too ! I like this video and I guessed which dice was the better choice ,100 % !"
Christ the guys hands are going to be yellow for a week.
"Expert: has a hard time distinguishing between cheap and expensive black pepper 

Also expert: ""black pepper is where quality really makes a difference"" 
Hmmmmm"
Really? Eat readily a bark that isn’t even digestible? I bet he spat it out.
he said the same thing in 3 times in 3 minutes time... expert???
"He is messy AF!!
@SortedFOOD I would love this analysis by ebbers and a normal!"
"Great episode, I like it a lot. I like the messes that Ethan made all over the table and coating his hands. Next spice, all cleaned up."
The expert is hot n spicy...
if you have ocd. look away.
How does this man just shove black pepper in front of his nose and not sneeze immediately
I can’t. He’s making so much mess! HAHA
I buy frontier co op they have high quality spices 👌👌
gurl he is messy af!
"🤔🤔 cinnamon B is sold at the supermercado close to my house and it’s not that expensive, confusion, did not know I had a fancier cinnamon stick I just thought it was stupid Bc ever time I tried to grab it, it would break😂😂"
This guy seems the most expert out of the experts they've had. Busting out full scientific names
the cinnamon challenge got nothing on this guy
"Damn, he's messy"
We should talk more about the gorgeous murals behind the experts. Those are amazing!
Who allowed this man child to make this much of a mess
I bet this man is from Spain
Hi welcome to chilli peppers
Get this man some spoons or and plates or something. He makes a fkn mess haha
Is it just me or is this guy super attractive??
I'm here for the the background. The art is just amazing.
ethan is way cute
Ok know i know what is more expensive he already describes it
Backwards treble clef
this man flinging spices all over that table wtf
"Not gonna lie, being a spice expert myself (esp cinnamon) pretty disappointed with his simplistic review. There's soooo much he left out on what makes a quality spice. He's got some basic knowledge, has a wonderful camera personality but by no means an expert. First time I'm disappointed in one of these reviews, the rest of the ""expert"" vids I'm binge watching on quarantine are excellent."
"I always love the experts on this series, because they're all really respectful of the cheaper options, telling you which to go for for which things"
I don’t think an expert guesses lol
How is this dude not sneezing his face off with all that pepper?!
"The Dutch Empire wants to 
know your L O C A T I O N"
"""Tastes like biting into a big red bell pepper""
You mean biting into a paprika?"
I thought the title said space expert and couldn't figure out how that related to spices
Messy messy
Im a little disturbed by how messy the table is every after review.
I'm Indian and I've never been so much jealous of a foreigner in whole of my life
Just because it's bigger does not mean that it's a better product... Cant wait to tell my girlfriend!
"Wait, there's more than 1 type of cinnamon?"
I think these are scripted and they already know which is which.
He had a seizure at 7:20
This guy definitely doesn't suffer from OCD.
I have an uncle who’s a spice expert
Your 16th century ancestors would be horrified by your wanton disregard for care in handling a King's ransom worth of spices.
I had to escape into the comments to avoid looking at the mess he made lol
Why darker-colored black pepper is better?
What are the additives used to prevent caking and clumping?
8:07 did he ReAlly smELL ThAt BlaCkPeppEr?!
He’s like a baby. He’s paying with it and then leaving a mess instead of putting it back
Why is he in such a rush
Nice name
5:10 rhizome* ftfy hehehehe
I guarantee if I was up there I couldn't tell the difference between any of these and that makes me sad since he makes them sound so complex
Cinnamomum verum sounds like one of Harry Potter's spells
7:20 man had a peppergasm
The spice must flow.
The British Empire would like to know your location
I like the fact he just makes such a mess and doesn't even give a damn about it xD
"this video was posted 14 months ago, I wonder if his hands are still yellow today from rubbing all that turmeric around"
please stop saying the spice is spicey
"How could they not do saffron or vanilla, they would have been such an exciting one."
He's hot. And smart. UNF.
I would love to know which spice grinder he was using. I have never seen one like it and it seems to work so much better than the typical versions
"His best comment? ""Be creative, experimental, if you don't like it, order a pizza, it's not the end of the world"" (I'm paraphrasing here, it's not verbatim). Cooking is no fun if we're going to worry about making mistakes. Sometimes mistakes suck, and sometimes the""mistake"" turns out to be better than the original recipe!"
Love your take on the cinnamon challenge!
"Cinnamon B is just more expensive because of a bunch of hipsters thought it was ""real"" cinnamon because it is called that in latin. Not totally a bunch of tools at all."
"He knows his stuff. 
But,

Am I the only one who looked at the mess he created?"
"Besides the tea expert someone suggested, you should bring a coffee expert"
Am I the only one who got stressed because of the mess he made?
He seems to have a good Acumen for spices lol.
SNORT IT
He's cute
”the expert” meme
So wait you’re using a Caucasian Male who probably seasons his chicken with his hopes and dreams as the forefront of this “spice expert” video??? The desi in me is laughing
Spices must be the hardest to guess
Saffron is too expensive and I don’t think Vanilla has that many expensive types
 @paulrud7139  yeah but you can get shop brand saffron or get one from an obscure niche spice market
 @timbuckley9841  true get him fake Saffron vs Persian Saffron
 @paulrud7139  Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. All of it is expensive.
"He's dead on with his analysis of each item, you hateful bigot."
Cinnamon b looks like a swisher
"As an Indian for whom these spices are a staple of over 80% of the food, I approve his exceptional analysis."
black pepper a is mccormicks
"Cannot stand black pepper that is cheap. Like, will not consume ever. Kampot is so good though."
"the worst it happens is you burn your stove.
just like what I did."
5:44 Mr sandman
Give the guy a tiny spoon wtf.
Anyone can be an expert when the answer is literally... ALWAYS B
"Can you picture his office 
Must have tumeic in the Ceiling"
"Common misconception--the capsaicin that makes spicy peppers hot is actually contained in glands called capsaicinoids that are on the pepper pod's inner lining, called the placenta. Sure, the capsaicin can get on the seeds, but it also gets on the fruit. 



If you have your doubts, just google it. The only problem is that once you know, you'll want to tell everyone and people seem to have a lot of confidence in the seed theory lol"
this dude like hmm lemme check rubs turmeric all over body great color
"This is the messiest episode ever lmao when he shakes it, parts fell😂"
"""citrus and fruity  flavors in black pepper"" boy if you dont ..."
Get your audio together please. Always loud or quite. No matter what video I watch. It's annoying
"Cinnamon challenge: I have dominated all across my path
Spice expert: keep talking."
"""I hate black pepper!"""
Woody. Spicy...im guessing its a wooden spice from a bark...hmmm
Ryan Goslinstein
Why is he so messy.
Some would say... he's a spicy boi
Peppercorns are fruits. Look it up
 @charlie_mario6292  but its not citrus...
 @charlie_mario6292  nor fruity
"Epicurious, do a pasta expert plz"
Longest Epicurous episode.
"Oh, come on! They should have brought a female spice expert, I wanted to make a ""spice girl"" joke."
LOVE THIS SERIES
"Cassia and ceylon cinnamon arent even the same tree type.   They grow in different regions aswell. 

Cassia is also a less heathy choice and has a higher concentration of the poisoness component in it (not dangerous in quantities we eat in general but why eat it anyway)


Oh and you should move all those spice prices are a total criminal ripoff i pay that per half a pound or pound not per oz."
My favorite chalkboard so far!
"I was more expecting to hear like ""what?!! no!"" kind of words"
"""The Spice must flow"" - Ethan Frisch, 2018"
"Flakey on the pepper flakes, as it isn't the seeds that hold the heat, but the embryonic membrane that hold the seeds to the pepper. It would be easier and cheaper to cut the peppers in half and scrape the seeds with a knife, but you are also removing the embryonic membrane as well; and the seeds are put back in either fostering the  illusion they have heat, or they believe that themselves.

With a higher end hot pepper, you dry them first, cut the end and shake out most of the seeds leaving the embryonic membrane intact. 

With the black pepper, it looks like a high quality to low quality commercial production. I paid quite a bit more for my black pepper collection, but figuring heavily is the uniqueness of the pepper corn as well how it was processed, and many estates do things in a unique manner. Even regarding white people, so soak the shell off in water, others let it fully ripen and then remove the shell. Yet that give you a variety where you can create your own unique flavors. I always give out my recipes out, but they can't figure out that the spices I use are very high quality and unique.

Want to learn cooking, no man hasn't lived until he finds himself in a kitchen with ten Indian women that absolute don't want you thare. But they insisted that I use Indian spices to cook with Indian food, and I figured out why. Because they are usually older and less in quality, they use increased quantities. They also lightly toast their spices to bring out the oils. Still, I messed with them because I used higher quality spices, and turmeric is definitely one of them and they could never figure out, why I had a much more dynamic flavor profile."
This was spicy.
"anybody who loves spices must visit kerala, india."
3am and the best thing I can do is watching this
I thought he said ethan bradberry
I never knew black  pepper was this serious. He did a great job.
Can't believe they didnt try out saffron!!
citrusie
13:37 C'mon Epicurious.  Give the man a real table! LOL
Spice man is messy.
7:30 ... well played.
Next expert better be a black guy that calls himself the chicken expert
why didn't they give him some salt?
Ooh they should make an alternate show where they take random people or ask an expert to guess on something they know nothing about
he's adorable
I would probably throw that guy out of my kitchen for making a mess like that.
This guy got messy I love it
"I kept expecting him to sneeze when he was smelling the spices, pepper specifically 🤣"
Damn this mans just makin a mess of that table
"I'm from India - the land of spices. Coming from a billion people, I have never heard of even one person describe any of those spices as fruity smelling as the above arbiter does."
Fruity black pepper?? I'm sorry what??
"Damn this one would be hard, especially blindfolded. With most of these episodes you can just guess whichever looks fancier, less artificial, or darker. By looks for the cinnamon I guess A would be more expensive because it looked darker, I was wrong lol."
https://youtu.be/yTy1Qyl03kI
This one was really great - they gave him 6 different spices to compare. Most of the other ones in this series just do 3 or 4.
2:30 cinnamon challenge
Does expensive mean better
I was expecting McCormick vs Spice Time.
Messy... very nice
Very messy!
Omfg his hands are going to be yellow for days after fingering all that turmeric.
Looks like Jason Newsted.
"THANK YOU!  It's pronounced Ter-mer-ric, not Chew-mer-ric!!"
Not a chance 😂😂
Just because y'all are known for spices doesn't mean y'all know everything.
the part when he said cumin smells sweet reminded me of that drake and josh episode where drake put cumin in his dad’s pancakes and josh said “I SAID CINNAMON” 😂😂
This man was on a mission to make the table as messy as possible
He's a spice expert but he can't correctly pronounce turmeric?
"I think this is the least obvious one in the entire series. Bread, salami etc. were easy"
I'm Ethan Frisch and I'm a Spice ( and everything nice ) expert
where do they find all these people
Damn this dude is gorgeous.
"Spice Expert: 2:27
Cinnamon Challenge: Am I joke to you?"
My guy straight up ate them and I respect that
Hope his spouse doesn't mind him playing with spice in the kitchen. Obviously you can only determine the quality if you put the spice all over your hands and the kitchen counter.
I got a feeling they cheat.
"This video made me look at spices in a whole different way. It even made me excited to try and mix spices in a different way - that was until, I went to the store and checked out the prices and the spices alone equalled to my entire normal, weekly shopping bill.. then my palate reverted back to ignorance is bliss"
Do good tree vs. Dirt weed
The mess I cant lol
Lol he flinched when he smelled black pepper A
"THE MESSINESS IS MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE! still, cool video tho"
He’s definitely one of the messiest experts I’ve seen!  : )
"Still can't pronounce the word 'three', tree reacts only 🌳"
When I'm playing burnout 3. I realize I'm not very good at race mode because I always got third or forth and never got first. And somehow i did get first for first time when I try to play race mode like a road rage mode.
DUDE YOU SCARED ME WITH THAT CRASH MODE TRANSITION
Here's a fact that alot of people don't know but road rage had a hidden 30 minute timer.
"B3 is a bit overrated

I recommend Revenge, it has a much better atmosphere and more destructive gameplay"
Amazing
"All time great game, shame on EA for making this open world in Paradise and not giving 3 a proper follow up. Hopefully Three Fields Ent(former Burnout 3 devs) , can get a proper budget and make a next gen equivalent to Burnout."
Why has no one tried to replicate this formula?? Just copy paste it if you have to for fuck sake! I miss this game so much

One of the greatest if not the greatest racing game I've ever played. Only game that comes close is Revenge. I actually prefer the Crash mode (in some ways) in Revenge since that's more about causing destruction than relying on powerups to achieve a high score.
Great review man. The perfect way to cover the fantastic and iconic burnout 3.
"Such a well constructed video mate! And my god, the music in this game! The music! It makes me so sad that that stuff is nowhere to be found in movies and games nowadays. 
And the crashes in this game are what make it! I find crashes in other racing games so dissatisfying. There's usually hardly any damage animations, and you kind of just bump off of stuff. I think it's mainly due to listening since a lot of games use real brands of cars and so they're restricted as to showing how dangerous they can be. It sucks"
what makes Burnout 3 any better than Burnout Revenge? 🤔
"Bro you will blow soon, such quality content on a small channel feels like such disrespect, stay at it 👌"
I am not crying.
I would invite my friend over just to play classic Xbox games and this was one of em. I love this game so much it's such a classic. Nice video you just got a new sub!
"You nailed it. Agreed with every point and now I'm feeling nostalgic, how can I play that on my PC?"
Here before 1k. Your gonna get there in no time bro keep up the content
"Super excited for the new game in the series, Burnout: Tree!"
 @luminouscactuz9510  The developers are branching out! ;D
"Yay, you posted.
Sorry for being late."
Thanks! 💙😊
"Little things, but there's an argument that it is so who knows"
" @jiggins63  since its your favorite game. what are a few of the things that put 3 over Revenge for you? because I always hear people say 3 is better, but none of them ever say why. I always just viewed 3 as Revenge without traffic checking. Revenge was amazing already, so by default that would make them both good games."
Thanks! ❤
"Thanks, appreciate it ❤"
"Thanks, sadly it's only available on ps2, xbox or xbox 360 via backwards compatibility 🙁 maybe a ps2 emulator would have it but it's not an area I know too much about 🤷‍♂️"
" @jiggins63  I have an XBox 360, I'll have to see if it's available for download, good shout, thanks."
No problem 👍
"I got it for a ps2 emulator, maybe try that?"
Thanks cabbage ❤🥬
Man this game is literally my childhood. Out of all the games getting remasters recently it amazes me this hasn’t
It's a shame I never picked this up when I was a kid. I wasn't a fan of racing games until I played Furious Karting and I know I would have loved this.
Subscribed because of the quality of content.
EA decided to remaster Burnout Paradise when they could've remastered this or Revenge 😬
" @jiggins63  This would have been the better choice, Revenge had some cool features, better graphics and great lighting effects but it lost some of the best elements of Takedown.
I would really like to see a remaster of this."
Same. This was my favorite as a kid
"The controls genuinely hold up 16 years later, and the graphics aren't too bad either, I'd say it's worth trying 👍"
$10 for the XBox 360 version.
Cheers! ❤😊

Different Types Of Alien Species On Earth - whatweknow
https://youtu.be/xg_js3raIW0"
A fallen past technologically advanced worldwide civilization debunks aliens at every level..
"They are not stubborn, they just not want people to know the truth"
Oh crap don't do the ancient aliens lies please.  They have NO BASIS IN TRUTH AND NO FACTS TO BACK THEM UP. There is a guy who built all the tools and the machine out-of ancient techniques and technology. It's no super special deal.  Ancient aliens doesn't have one theory that I can't completely debunk. Ask I can happily prove it. There are no aliens that came down and did anything for us or helped us. There may have been sightings and maybe abductions like is supposed to be going on today. Yet nowhere is there any proof they did any kind of intervention. The Roman's moved and repaired the wall in Jerusalem with a 690 ton stone. Lol put it right in between the others. A man in flint Michigan can move a 30 ton stone by himself just using wood stone weights and a long wooden lever.  There is absolutely nothing ancient aliens has that is even worth listening to yes it's that bad.
"GOD and HIS SON are aliens, how can we know that? GOD created the heaven and Earth... Which would put HIM in a place, other than that HE created, CHRIST left as others have while alive 🗡️🤓"
wooow
"Aliens 👽 😆🤣😂
Noone will ever convinced me that Alien 👽exist.."
Rh Neg blood
they found something  when all the elites flew there john kerry ect
"Yeah..... most of what The Ancient Astronaut Theory show's premise was based upon a few books written by a single guy. For the life of me I can't remember his darned name. But if you read those books of his just about everyone on the show is just regurgitating what he wrote. Why can't I remember his name. Darn me!!!!

Anyways they were all debunked. I think of this Ancient Astronaut crap and I go back to that movie Zeitgeist. That's all I can think of. As an older 20 year old when Zeitgeist first came out I was entranced and mesmerized by Peter Joseph's ""discoveries"" about all the religions of the world sharing the same attributes as Christianity. I swallowed that garbage word for word. It turned out years later I researched the religious material Peter Joseph expounded, and.... well..... he made it up. Yeah.... dude made it all up. There was a woman he was working with back then who died of cancer a little later on where he got most of his information from named S. Achyrae (Pen name) and books she wrote. The problem is that S. Achyrae basically just made up her own story on world religions as a whole and just interweaved whatever her imagination could spin. Quite depressing that I was duped like that. Just imagine what's happening in America today, and the saddest part is I still hear people puking up that Zeitgeist bullcrap on religion. 

Yeah people.... it's called research. It's called citing information. But educational information nowadays is more on whatever one can imagine and sounds good enough to dupe a populace. If I was that arrogant back then just imagine how many others are now, but as we can see that ""imagination education"" as I call it has taken America by storm. It's depressing to say the least......"
"Man,  mostly white men have corrupted, defiled & twisted EVERY single thing since the very beginning......it's just THAT simple people."
Seems you are perpetuating a big bang vast universe jesuit origin reality. This is a fallacy.
The last ice age wasn't millions of years ago it was 100k years ago and lasted for 25k
Not aliens. Us. We are stubborn and not all of us idiots. To say aliens is just another excuse to keep promoting ignorance and mental laziness.
"I love these because they open the mind to miraculous. I believe it’s essential to examine the scriptures though bc prophetically and historically they are proven time and again to be most authentic giving us dates, times locations for future and past events. They are not aliens, they are inter dimensional.  We have universal flood stories, so everything WAS destroyed, and it was recent. We have universal giant stories. We have universal gods mating with women to create hybrids.  We have a supreme God almost universally. I’m sticking with Christianity"
I don't know about these hidden histories but here's a provable factual one.   The so called black people of America are not from Africa but are the true indigenous Americans!
"A woman buried a chicken carcass in her back yard. 5 years later she dug it up and sent it in to be carbon dated. They said it was 10, 000 years old😂😂😂 imagine what else they have told us thats wrong! Gow would they know how old something is? Dont give me that BS they know how fast this and that decay so..... They don't know how old anything is outside of a few thousand years old. They just guess and make thing match their agenda😂😂 they lie lie lie"
"If you want the truth about where we really are, go watch videos over at The potters clay Channel"
So no Alien women mate with human men???  Only the Alien men with human women??  😞
"Enoch CHAPTER 15  1. And he answered and spoke to me with his word: “Hear, and fear not, Enoch, you just man and scribe of justice, approach here, and hear my words.  2. And go, say to the watchers of heaven, who have sent you, that you should petition for them: ‘You should petition for men, and not men for you.  3. Why have you left the high, holy, and everlasting heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men, and taken wives unto yourselves, and acted as the children of earth, and begotten giants as sons? 4. While you were spiritual, holy, having eternal life, you defiled yourselves with women, and with the blood of flesh have begotten children, and have lusted after the blood of men, and have produced flesh and blood as they produce who die and are destroyed. 5. Therefore I have given them wives that they might impregnate them and children be born by them, as it is done on earth.  6. You were formerly spiritual, living an eternal life without death to all the generations of the world. 7. Therefore I have not made for you any wives, for spiritual beings have their home in heaven. 8. And now the giants, who have been begotten from body and flesh, will be called evil spirits on earth, and their dwelling-places will be upon the earth.  9. Evil spirits proceed from their bodies; because they are created from above, their beginning and first basis being from the holy watchers, they will be evil spirits upon the earth and will be called evil spirits.  10. But the spirits of heaven have their dwelling-places in heaven, and the spirits of the earth, who were born on the earth, have their dwelling-places on earth.  1. And the spirits of the giants, who cast themselves upon the clouds, will be destroyed and fall, and will battle and cause destruction on the earth, and do evil; they will take no kind of food, nor will they become thirsty, and they will be invisible.  12. And these spirits will not (?) rise up against the children of men and against the women because they have proceeded from them. In the days of murder and destruction.   CHAPTER 16  1. Аnd of the death of the giants, when the spirits have proceeded from the bodies, their flesh will decay without judgment; thus they will be destroyed till that day when the great judgment over all the great world will be completed over the watchers and the impious.  2. And now to the watchers who have sent you that you should petition for them who were formerly in heaven say:  3. ‘You have been in heaven, and though the secrets were not yet revealed to you, still you knew illegitimate mysteries, and these you have, in the hardness of your hearts, related to the women, and through these mysteries, women, and men increase wickedness over the earth.’  4. Tell them, therefore: ‘You have no peace!’”   Secular professors use this Book to lie to you about where we came from."
In this video you talk about the world uniting against a common enemy.  Do you know what happens in revelation when the world unites?
The very first paragraph in ENOCH will point us to today 🤓🗡️ it's happening right before their faces
Are the Giant skull at the beginning was a fake
4:28  2.860 metres apart?!? You sure about that?
"Who's running the world or better yet, where did the current religious constructs get their beginnings? Re-member, the victor's write the his-story. And this his-story was a buncha deception agreed upon by those behind the current religious constructs and the wealth. The money is even fiat... and it's something that makes this reality function... and it comes with BS interest! The money is fake, the food is contaminated with GMOs, the water has fluoride, churches have 501c3s now along with ATMs in the lobbies now, the letter J crushes the jesus story because it wasn't invented until 1524... the sun is not 93 million miles away and if so, the clouds must be also because we can see from NASA (NASA in the Hebrew means to ""deceive"") space imagery, photos and videos alike,  that the Sun often times has clouds around it! And why is it that the moon is in title or grid lock and only one side is ever presented to our Earth (Ki)? Why are there pyramids on the moon, mars and saturn? Why does every single culture of Antiquity throughout the entire world have documented (whether it's baked into clay tablets, carved on walls in caves, on scrolls on papyrus, and/or of the oral tradition, these worldwide cultures of Antiquity say the exact same thing: that at some point in their cultural existences (the farther back East one goes, the older these cultures get, right), other worldly beings, usually giants, would suddenly appear from the sky and either cause them much grief or teach them how to build and prosper (makes sense wen you consider the jump from hunter-gatherers to civilizations (which suddenly included megalithic structures on the seven continents in such a short time). You won't find this kinda 411 in any current education curriculums because the inversion of EVERYTHING in every aspect of the current paradigm is designed to keep us from the Truth! Isaiah 5:20 is a witness... along with Ki/Earth/Gaia and the Ancestors. ASE'and NAMASTE 💯💜"
There is no evidence suggesting we cane from an alien species. None at all. Nothing to suggest abduction and implantation in a Virgin at all. In fact the ancient astronaut theory has no more proof them man coming from apes. Not only are those two ideas dumb they are destructive to science and us finding out our true history. Rocks being moved and stacked or placed some where proves nothing other then we haven't figured out yet how they did it. We do know for fact the Roman's repaired the temple wall with a 680 ton stone. So that destroys any problem of moving 20 ton blocks and stacking them. Again ancient aliens has no credit or validity and is easily debunked just look into it hell it's not hard to debunk it.

"Some people who study these things believe that the people of the world were more technologically advanced (if you go back far enough in history) than we are now. For example, look up the ancient Mayan airplane model found by archaeologists which present-day aeronautical engineers used to build the same exact plane that actually flies. Some Christians believe that the ancient people who lived before the great worldwide flood mentioned in the Bible were technologically more advanced and that this explains the evidence of that that we have been seeing. So you have Christians  who believe these advanced people to have been wiped out by the flood and nonChristians who believe that they were aliens or received their advanced technology from aliens.
We have lots of evidence that our government and maybe even the Catholic hierarchy in general will push this idea of aliens or an alien god in order to unite the world under one religious and governing system in the future. Watch for the Biblical prophecy that the world is going to eventually become one world government! I think most people are aware of this worldwide movement by now. If not, it will become apparent at some point. (You can look up Klaus Schwab and the WEF, and the WEF Young Global Leaders: Canada’s Justin Trudeau, Germany’s Merckel, (sp?), Russia’s Putin, Ukraine’s Zelensky, and there are other famous leaders. You can also look up the infamous globalist organization, the Rockefeller Foundation, and find their Lockstep document planning out the Covid pandemic and future pandemics (called Scenarios for...); the SPARS document, and the event 201 practice for the Covid pandemic that we know the globalist elites conducted. Heads up, they also wargamed a monkeypox pandemic last year.)These are not theories, guys.
Also, if you read Darwin on Trial and the Evolution Conspiracy with an open mind, you will discover that the theory of evolution is not a correct scientific interpretation of the rise of man. (These books are incredibly eye-opening.)Hope this helps someone out there!"
BRAVO.. BRAVO ... THIS IS WHAT IM SAYING... SO I OBVIOUSLY DID MY HOMEWORK AS WELL AS THIS CHANNEL... FANTASTIC... VERY NICE PRESENTATION!
This life is one big lie. Men in power know that and the Vatican know it. They are the zoo keepers.

"No, aliens/gods are the fallen angels. They took them human wives and they gave birth to babies who were the giants on earth. The Nepahlem! The story about Canaan is ture. The Canaanites were giants. The Bible story is true!"

"Here's what I think. Everyone has different versions, and there's official versions without the ins and outs, and it's put in very boring ways so no one really cares, or wants to read, or know, and when they do learn, because of the way it's taught, and who they're taught it by whether true, or right, or not they just accept it. I don't think I'll ever truly know but I don't care that much. I just think sly people run shit, and I think that's all I need to know really, because I think that tells us good people didn't win."
"Regardless what you believe,
Know that History is controlled in the present, not the past, and the story has been changed many, many times for every reason, both good and bad."

Very grateful for the work of Graham'Hancock and Dr Robert Schoch. I'm an Egyotologist and it's very sad how the minds of most Egyptologists are closed to the evidence of pre flood civilizations and the age of the monuments on the Giza Plateau. The evidence of an advanced pre flood civilization is compelling and very exciting. Thank you.
Yeah we've been brainwashed the way our world really is FE 🤔
Eric is a pretty decent guy but his ancient alien questions lack not just evidence but some times comman sense. I don't know of a good point about the ancient alien  theory that actually works and some what points to them. Ancient written accounts all have one thing in comman they see lights shields or craft in the sky. The unfortunate thing is the one thing they all have in comman - they never contact man
You might find MH’s comment helpful or interesting!
Did you not read God's in chariots are you serious? The evidence pilling up
 @zimunda3252  hey yeah I read the book years ago and know a lit about the ancient alien theories. I'm sorry to have to say there is absolutely no evidence at all. The only thing piling up is bad science and made up stories to make the ancient alien idea seem valid. I mean no disrespect i had a friend into this and I showed him how messed up it was. Give me what you think is the best evidence for ancient aliens helping humans or doing anything but maybe being seen  in the sky from time to time.
 @zimunda3252  seriously tell me what the best evidence you think that book or ancient aliens has? I have studied this topic for a Ling time now

So everything we've been taught and learnt is bullshit? So where does this leave God and Jesus's?  This is really so much to take in
"We repeat history because of the original sin, belief in outside Gods. I am God until I think I am not. That is how hypnosis works. Moses was a Greek hypnotic fable induced in all three major religions over the ages and belief systems to bring sodomy and hate against women.  In other words Moses God is Satan.   Face the truth women have NEVER been treated like they matter one little bit since Mary 1 was beheaded in Ephesus Turkey, and again in London in about the 1600s as Queen Mary.  We literally are reborn every 100 years or so and we repeat emotional history within the same soul groups until women are restored.  Until then man lives with half a brain and it shows, mentlemen. It shows. XO"
"Maybe the globalists don't want us to know how many times they've wiped us out before. Our history is such a crock but they think we believe their lies. We don't!! We just want to know what ""they"" know."
"Then where did the ""alien astronauts"" go after all this supposed building...and where are they now? I call bs!"
WOW the second picture is a fake as the research .
You lose credibility by flashing these hoax photos like that gargantuan Skelton that was proved a hoax decades ago.
There was a time when not anyone can say anything unless that 'story ' had been approved by judicial council ... The Inquisition !
"No ancient astronauts I'm afraid.
The ancient drawings depict plasma effects visible in the sky during cataclysmic events and drawn by surviving witnesses."
"Nice fossilized cassette tape there. I’m sure someone went back in time and dropped it off in some cement. Lol, j/k I found the information on that and it is made with an old way of petrifying, but is is in fact NOT ancient.  The credibility of this video just collapsed.  Sorry"
"The story about the race in the Antarctica.
The story behind them. The atlanteans were martens from Mars. around 50,000 so years ago.
I asked my contactee about the race in Antarctica, I asked if they were from Mars. She is from the Dakota tribe, descendant from those who migrated here long ago as a request to help Enki's descendants, or created new life that had been abandoned and left to their own demise. As a contactee, this is only ever done face to face with her own star relations and other star visitors, she does not channel. The one thing she did tell me, is what annoys the star visitors the most, is the wrongly deciphered info found, misinterpretation of information passed on, or lack of it. So you end up with multiple variations of different recorded events, some that never took place here. I believe what angered her the most in recent times, is finding out the Corey Goode will have you believe that our sun blew up Tiamat. This is not true, we are living on what is left of Tiamat that had been Terra-formed after a great cosmic war. It was Maldek that was destroyed.

Answer: No, not from Mars, they came from the other side of the Milky-way, known as SHINTO. It means, Tall Minds. They were just a group of families consisting of, scientists and botanists when they crash landed here. The land mass they exist within now, was in a different place at the time of impact. Their craft after being hit by lightening, was rendered unbalanced causing them to loose control of their craft which ended in a very bad landing. The craft sustained to much damage leaving them stranded here.  This race, had no clue as to what was here when they crashed. According to their records, they came across a beautiful land & water world during their travels wanting to take a closer look. Their own home was also a land & water world. Until people here are taught & shown what they are living upon, they will never figure out the meaning of real life. However, those who crash landed here, did understand quite well just what a cosmic world really is.

The crash took place long after the flood. By the time they were discovered here by other star visitors some time after Enki's rein, the children had grown & settled in with their elders long passed on. It is the elders that have been discovered in stasis burial chambers beneath the ice cap. It was the children who grew up remaining, not wanting to leave as they no longer knew any other home but here. It is quite true they did make their way to the Pyramids where they then began to rein over Enki's creations. They were good to them, eventually they died off. However, they did mix with Enki's creations of new life that survived the flood. Unfortunately ,most of the babies died as there was a significant height & anatomy difference between themselves & the people already born here. Very few new born's survived. The mixed breeds that did survive, left with other star visitors in the later years of their lives to be returned to the original home world of their decadents.

Below is an answer from my contactee after I suggested this is why Lemuria sank over time along with Atlantis, and why we are finding artifacts and ruins both on land and under the sea in modern day times.

(The real Christ was a elongated skull child, one of the grown elongated children's child. Romans found the story on a pyramid wall long after Egypt had been all but abandoned at the time. They stole it for themselves changing names, dates, locations, then used it against their own people together with the Roman Catholic Priests,  in a very threatening way as a means of political religious control. Roman soldiers & priests told a lot of lies back then, & Catholic priests still lie about the truth today. Back then, many civilizations lived on floating cities. They fought among themselves before & after Enki & Enlil time here. You would not expect anything different as they were descendants from Anunnaki war lord minds. It was in their genetic makeup to be that way & still is today.


With the exception of the native land people, others here have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to past history, along with no clue what soever as to what it is they are even living on the exterior of, nor do they know what S/HE is out there in the Cosmos that created the beginning of the Cosmic Realm. People here don't understand there is a living, growing fetus inside beneath their feet. Her head is beneath what they are calling, the North Pole, her feet beneath, the South Pole. With 1 arm stretched out to the East, the other to the West.

To live in harmony with Mother Earth, you need to understand a baby's movement inside a mother's womb. When she moves around inside the membrane within her shell, the scattered exterior debris moves with her as her outer protective shell is flexible. A human baby does a complete turn around twice during incubation. Tiamat/Gaia turns many more times than twice during her own incubation at a slower rate.  You don't want to be here if that happens, as the upheaval of surface debris is tossed all over the place. Ice caps keep her body temperature stable, it is the same for all the Cosmic Eggs of those who have not yet hatched. Where ever her head and feet are, you have your ice caps. Scientists have only just come to this realization in the last few years.

In the beginning of a new creation of  life, even though the intention was first for a new slave labor in mind, they were taught the truth about this world, the life within & how to always respect, love & care for this life. Those who migrated here, always knew the truth. That truth has remained within the hearts of the native people for many thousands of years, long before man created a false concept he calls, time. For others, the truth was lost along the way.

Where in any school have the people ever been taught the truth about their own existence, or about the inner world they live upon, NOWHERE! Most have no idea they are living on top of debris scattered around the exterior of an egg with inner earth people living deep inside the debris from an exploded world/egg caused through war. They know little to nothing of the life that existed on the exterior before it was knocked out of it's original harmonious celestial orbit.

Question: When Gaia (Tiamat) starts moving, are the land masses rising and lowering. 

Answer: Exactly. 

So now that you know what my contactee had to say, just picture how the Piri Reis Map was before Gaia moved. The movement created two new poles that is now covering the crash site. Plate movements are not what we have been told, these are her ribs her breathing in & out."
Is that skull real?
"I'm beginning to think, we are the dumbest,  most blind, closed-minded race that has ever lived on this planet!"
"Change the word hiding 'something', to the word 'Everything' and it will be covered!"
in my opinion there is no alien. i think theres an old advance civilization wipeout
"Oh I see now where the insane people come to watch stuff.

"Not sure about that. But they have made several very valid points. One that has real disturbed me is the interview with the first astronauts to come back from I believe what was the first successful moon landing. Listen to what the quietest of the astronauts said when asked what he saw when he looked out into space. He said he  that he did not recall seeing any star’s, but instead a black void. I noticed that the other astronauts quickly tried to change his comment. Another thing, that particular astronaut rapidly faded into history, not much about him in the historical context..."
I'm shocked how dumb the premise is.
The carak stones look like a assembly line
"Not Aliens, it was us. Modern man has been around for at least 200000 Years. A long time. We have achieved our current civilisation in less than 7000 years. And this despite numerous setbacks. So, imagine what could have been achieved by our ancestors. During the Toba event some 75000 Years ago mankind was decimated to somewhere between 3000 and 10000. What was before this event, what had we achieved, what was lost. Imagine something like that today. We would lose most of our civilisation within a few years. We all know how to use electricity, computers, phones, but who can build them or generate electricity? Within a decade we would revert to something like the stone age, and would have to start the long drag back to civilisation as we know it. So, yes, there are some great examples of things we cannot explain, but it was not Aliens who did this, it was us, we have just forgotten."

"Everything has to die to begin again!! Everything we find are from previous humans/Aliens who have lived on earth over millions of years, we are being observed continuosly like animals in a zoo, we are a project of Aliens and live by their rules, they make sure we do not destroy ourselves and our planet which is what happened on Mars, there is life throughout  this universe some of them  also being suppressed about knowing the truth of their history, the Shadow goverment/Aliens are controling our government to keep everything we know to be true!! Is being made out to be just fantassy, we are to evolve on our own as many, many other previous races here on earth have done, and at certain points in time the human race is wiped out to restart a new race, natural disasters are not natural but controlled by them."

What is that picture @0:23 seconds?
@5:30 the book of Enoch also speaks of birth between God's and women in the bible directly. The only reason why the it's no longer used is because it conflicted with Judaisms view of christ the son.
"The rows of Carnac stones are not 2860 metres apart - I know, I've been there! In continental Europe they write decimals differently to how the British and other countries write them, with a comma instead of a full stop, so 2.86 metres would be written in France as 2,86. Seeing as we put a comma after a thousand decimal, someone's taken that to read 2,860. So, 2.86 metres - about 7 feet apart - sounds right. It is a fantastic site and well worth a visit."
this has become my favorite new channel. you are brave for going against the mainstream narrative. keep up the good work. people need to know this information

Dumb? Yes. But for those who are still seeking truth it may trigger their thirst for knowledge and they may look further into what is being falsely represented to them as historical fact. Maybe they will start to question the holes in so many historical descriptions of events. Historical inaccuracies abound.

That doesn't hold up at all billionaires are building underground bunkers that protect them from any disaster and can hold out for years.  Also governments know the true history of mankind and have built bunkers as well!  If what your say is true our ancestors would of built bunkers and there tech would of survived.  If everyone in the bunkers die out I guess your theory could hold up buy there are millions of bunkers around the world at this point.
"so could this be a reason why other planets appear uninhabited, when maybe they are just evolving, and we never, or it is very rare that we evolve at the same time"

Thank you! Will do!
"So you can draw some shapes... well done, a primary school child given a ruler and compasses with a little teaching can draw 'perfect' shapes without understanding the math behind them and a college student can easily master pythagorian math. Theses sacred shapes are just that... shapes, and they appear 'sacred' because the most basic of them are naturally occring and they look pleasing to the eye. Do some real research and look into the actual Mathamatics your speaking about before you spout your 'devine' nonsence. There are no space races apart from humans and the aliens you seak are the humans who have held and horded knowledge (often psycedelic drug based rituals) of self, the true devine and complex math/physics for themselves. Using the rest of humanity as their test tube."
"The historical time lines of many historical accounts are as inaccurate as the stories themselves. We have been lied too about everything. They are changing history as we speak. I am of an agar that I am literally seeing it happen. Believe nothing that they say, all lies and deception."
" @lynncarlson2463  yes , you are absolutely right and my instincts tell me my entire existence is somehow manipulated from outside the zone where humans can effect anything"
By a debunker ...like you
wrong.
how dare you let trivial things like peer reviewed testing and evidence get in the way of OUR TRUTH! it's........ Aliens
 @mikeoliver9483  be quiet sheep. Go watch the news on tv instead.
"throne ii,  Correct,  thus the changing, hiding of the real 'truth' of mans history began at that time, and continues today....sadly."

Acoustic levitation
That and frequencies for levitation of matter. Funny thing is that in the Bible it’s stated that there was a race called the Sayers. Also that when these giants spoke it hurt people’s ears to hear them. Just a thought.
 @lynncarlson2463  where does it say any of that?
wyt about ufos being depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs?
"Demons, not aliens. And angels. I used to believe that it was aliens, they really push that theory, that ridiculous evolution theory as well, neither has ever been unequivocally proven as fact. If people realized how much was being hidden from us? They would realize that what is being hidden validates the Bible to a disturbing degree. Ask yourselves this, why would they do this? Don’t get me wrong, I was never a Bible thumper. But we know now that there were giants, amongst other things, and this information has been hidden from the general public. At length and expensive, I might add."
MH’s recent comment might be interesting or eye-opening to you!
Go watch videos over at The Potters Clay Channel. You will see the truth of where we are
Look for the moving stars up there you will see a ufo they move at light speed and have a dark spot a bit like a doughnut
" @lynncarlson2463  god and angels have yet to be proven but you speak as if their existence is a fact but aliens as fiction, religious people are hypocritical, crazy people"
😅
Glad you enjoy it!
Graham Hancock is awesome he has stuff everywhere and if you watch Joe Rogan he's got great videos with him on there
Narration was perfect this time 👌🏾. And history is so inconsistent. I don’t know what to believe. I just try to live my life around all this chaos
"Since when is TRUTH put on mainstream TV 24/7? Prometheus (the fallen angel who gave us fire but demanded blood saceifice) Productions' Ancient Aliens is A DECEPTION - propaganda - we are ALONE in this enclosed, flat earth. They're not aliens , they're Angels - and most of them mean to control and corrupt us from our DNA to our beliefs. Stop pushing lies like evolution, deep space and aliens. Look at a planet with a Bikon P900 and you will see nothing but LIGHT moving in a watery substance..."
"""I do not believe anymore that UFOs are simply the spacecraft of some race of extraterrestrial visitors. This notion is too simplistic to explain their appearance, the frequency of their manifestations through recorded history, and the structure of the information exchanged with them during contact."" - Dr. Jacques Valle 

""An impressive parallel can be made between UFO occupants and the popular conceptions of demons. UFOs can project images or fabricated scenes designed to change our belief systems... human belief... is being controlled and conditioned, man's concepts are being rearranged, and we may be headed toward  a massive change of human attitudes toward paranormal abilities and extraterrestrial life. - Dr. JV

""The symbolic display seen by the abductees is identical to the type of initiation ritual or astral voyage that is imbedded in the [occult] traditions of every culture...the structure of abduction stories is identical to that of occult initiation rituals...the UFO beings of today belong to the same class of manifestation as the [occult] entities that were described in centuries past.""

"ARE ANGELS HUMANS THEN? IF NO, THEN WHY CAN'T I LABEL THEM AS ALIENS?? Just because u assume they're special since they're related to god somehow? So naive. U think our ancestors in recent history knew any better?"
"There is reflection of the sky in the water below... yes... and there is water vapour above yes... but not a sea. the bule your seeing is the refraction of light causing the white/yellow light of the sun to bend into the blue part of the colour spectrum. It's why the sunsets and rises are a different colour, there is more air, dust particles and water vapour for the light to travel through so the bending is greater... See Prysims and light refraction for reference. It looks light light on a watery sbstance because despite DBTruth's belief in his camera it cant focus on the planet sized object... The blur is quite common and is just because it is out of focus or unable to truly see the image as there isn't enought light hitting the sensor to make a crisp image. Maybe with a better telephoto lens (not digital zoom... Optical zoom!!!) or a telescope with a good optical resolution you might just see the planets that Copernicus and Galilaeo first tracked, and worked out the math for a solar system with. That modern physiscisits and mathmatiticians along with astronimers notes from back before telescopes have calculaed, mapped and shown to be where we think they are. As well as get photography of them from earth and in space, from close and far. Then to be so accureat with our predictive math we have landed on many of them.
I have personally seen the rings of saturn and several of the moons of Jupiter with a fairly cheap but quality telescope and I garentee you if you were to do the same you would be quite supprised how lacking even the best of telephoto lenses on a camera really is."

"Dan&Dee’s Daughter Lol Yes I see your point and agree - of course there are good Angels and entities that just don't care for us either way. The Bible says to TEST the spirits. That's the key.

"All plastic needs to be recycled. 
There should be no single use plastic made.
All new plastic products should be made from recycled materials

Ideally it should be refused ;) Because recycling plastic is energy intensive and plastic can only be recycled a very limited amount of time (about 3 to 5).
Just googled what snuff films are…… i need a minute
Still my favorite movie.
"i have just three words, if you'll forgive me: fuck...this...movie!"
Every comment I make on YouTube I get the same responses due to my username. I feel at home here :)
"I cannot recommend the Cursed Films documentary on Shudder enough. Turns out the trial for murder is absolute garbage. Never happened. The cast has a lot of negative things to say about the film, in particular the animal killings. It's a short watch coming in around 50 minutes. It's still slimy and exploitative as Hell, but seeing a lot of the ""legend"" of it get disproved is interesting, to say the least."
I actually saw this film on YouTube about a year. I was a bit outraged that the whole thing was on YouTube. It’s not anymore. Really horrible waste of film.
❤❤❤ masterpiece!
I saw this on a first date lol
"I watched this film and as an avid hunter I knew immediately those were real animal deaths.  It did admittedly give the second half violence more realism in my mind so job well done, you psychopath."
I watched this finally a couple of years ago as well as a couple of the other main cannibal movies from the time. Two things....the soundtrack for this movie is amazing. The other is that the 'cannibals' are the 'good guys' in all the movies. They are just doing their thing when westerners come along thinking they know better.
The fucking movie Zulu treated the natives better than this shit
"It is possible for a film to be horribly exploitative, shamelessly brutal and rightly disreputable immoral in other words and still have elements of artistic  brilliance, even historical  significance. Cannibal Holocaust is the Triumph Of The Will or Birth Of A Nation of sleazy genre movies"
"This is a bad movie which until lately was one of my favorites, then finally unnumbed because of the despicable animal cruelty and bts horror stories, I started to see his flaws. It's hard to admitting, but still entertaining, minus the obvious."
You look like thom yorke
"I watched this movie up to the killing the little monkey rat, I couldn’t stand the screaming and blood from the creature."
The animal cruelty aside this is a very smart film and of a different calibre from the other cannibal films of the same era.
The fact this video didn’t get 5 million views years ago is scary. ❤
"I know we shouldn't speak ill of the dead... but fuck Deodato, man. I can say that with my whole chest, that guy sucked."
"Great Movie , also Banned in Germany . 🤘👍🔨"
"EXCELLENT REVIEW,"
Am I the only one who thinks Ryan looks like Conor Mcgregir?
"I got this recommended to me almost exactly after watching this movie which was absolutely vile, disgusting and horrible."
This not the first found footage the first was Came Before: The Connection in 1961
I like the movie it aint as bad as saló lol i feel like people hate on this to much
The first 20 seconds was already the cringiest shit I've ever heard
"i love that the message of the movie is of critique of western hypocrisy (colonialism among other things) and this comment section is all triggered westerners whining about animals being killed while likely ordering burgers on grubhub every day in their comfortable homes. The turtle was food for the natives, there just happened to be a camera rolling while it got killed this time. Their lifestyle is 100 times more eco-friendly then ours."
"I watched this movie on an illegal streaming site and there was no video quality option for it anywhere so I had to sit through it in its mighty pixelated glory. At first I felt kinda bummed about it but after finishing it I felt like I just dodged a bullet, I wouldn't have had the stomach to finish it with a quality over 480p"
"I have most of the banned cannibal films. 'apocalypse' has to be one of the better ones. I got a copy of 'ferox' but it is so heavily censored it can hardly be called a horror film anymore.
I like what Eli (Roth) was doing with 'green inferno' which was a tribute to these films, but part of me felt he was still trying to hard to impress Quinton."
please upload the Hindi dubbed
How to download this movie
I don't mind the horror make up of the seine of people getting killed because it's make-up.  But the actual killing of animals I can't deal with.  That shit was real and extremely fucked up.
FYI: The DVD for this movie comes with an animal cruelty free cut.
"If you eat meat and you're talking about ""animal cruelty"" in the film, go fuck yourself."
"Yeah the turtle death i had to skip past it and even what I DID manage to see of it was, idk that I have words. Unnecessary doesn't exactly cut it here. If I mutilated my dog like that for the sake of content, I would be jailed. So how was the film maker able to get away with this and even the actors.... Idk.... Some things you could not pay me enough for, and having this movie on your resume would probably do more harm than good IMO. Good review though!"
Despite this movie being really unmoral i’m still quite glad it wasn’t what I thought it was because I thought it was gonna be about the Holocaust so thankfully it wasn’t
I've always wanted to see what actual animal bodies look like from the inside so thanks to the creator of this movie
In Germany their was a incident called the cannibal cafe. It was a cafe on the dark web that serves humans. It was only a website as far as anyone knew. However one guy in America was intrigued by this and talked with the creator of cannibal cafe. The American agreed to go to Germany and be eaten by this man. So he did then the website and cafe was disband by the German government.
"Anyone who eats meat has no right to object to the animal violence in CH. They are all quick, clean kills, and were genuinely eaten by the Indigenous actors. If that constitutes animal cruelty, so does every slaughterhouse in the world. I'd be fine with that. Are you?"
nice
"Saw this movie for the first time today with my friend. When there was 15-20min left of the movie, I was like ok it has calm down now. ABSOLUTELY NOT lmaooo. At the end of the film I was thinking to myself, “what do the holocaust had to do with this”? 😂. What a fucked up movie"
Just finished this movie. It’s surprisingly really good besides the animal killing ofc. I thought the message was good and is still really relevant today. Someone said it would’ve translated better as a book and I agree
So let me get this straight. You committed a felony for the sake of entertainment?
Step 1: dont
Meat is awesome. Look up liver king. He is a true American hero
 @eddiew2325  Lol!!!!!!!
Thanks man I watched one man one icepick and it was kinda cool I guess
"This movie was so underrated, i love this movie"
this movie could've really become a classic horror movie if it was handled correctly. by correctly i mean DON'T FUCKING KILL ANIMALS
Everyone involved with this movie has expressed regret for its existence.
Sort of seems like Green Inferno copied this movie.
I just watched this movie for the first time and I think I found my limit. This movie is disgusting and disturbing. I threw up after watching it. And I read Berserk and that is tame compared to this movie. God I hate it.
this film is a hood classic romantic film
"Imo, Jordan Peele's Nope pretty much did what this movie tried to do, but better. At least in Nope, real animals weren't killed/exploited all while trying to teach a lesson about the dangers of exploitation."
teape
boo. boo wendy
The one movie genre I can’t handle is cannibalism even thinking about it gets me squeamish and not like zombies and such but actual cannibal movies and stories but at the same time I can’t help but be drawn to them too
"The whole thing reminds me of something that George Lucas said once, and i'm only praraphrasing: - If you wanna terrify people you just have to take a baby animal and kill It in front of them, open It up with a knife, the problem Is that such an action doesn't requiere any Kind.of artistry- 
Not to mention that Is repulsive. And that Is the thing with Cannibal Holocaust, it's just a bad movie. It's just another product of ego and people not wanting to make great art for the love of It, but instead they just want to feel like they just Made something that is ""bigger than thenselves"" or ""break the form"" in a very vague, superficial and masturbatory way because they just want the attention, it's the same kind of mentality that created the whole auteur theory bullshit and the annoyances of the method acting."
The scenes of the turtle trying to bring in his feet in before being hacked off is something I’ll never ever forget. Truly gut wrenching. Very few movies can leave a everlasting image like that.
Ah goddammit. My first horror movie I've watch is something cannibalism. I'm shocked enough till cry. I don't know what in my sister's mind that she left me to watch this. And my friend have a copy of this thing too. Complete madness. My childhood ruined
"Just some animals, dont act like a fucking pussy you need punched in the mouth."
"say what you will, that sound track is truly glorious and very much a painful bait and switch to the audience."
"God damn. I have a pretty strong negative reaction to animal cruelty videos when I accidentally see them on imageboards or whatever, but before I knew that the animal deaths in this film were real I thoroughly enjoyed watching them. The way the turtles leg twitched was so... ugh. Idk the right word. Now I'm kind of distraught for that little rat thing. Koati? It was so cute and now that I know it's suffering was real it's going to haunt me forever."
"Uncivilized people should be civilized . Period. This isn't the 12th century or 15th century, you don't get to live in the jungle and eat people. Not saying the film makers are good people but niether are the savages"
To watch a movie that had a director charged because the deaths looked so real has to be a very interesting experience
"the point of the movie was very clear.... ""I wonder who the real cannibals are""...The only reason this movie got banned is because of the animal killings."
Good review. Thanks for putting it together. This review is pretty good too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKgwMF8mtJU
Is that why your name is Patrick Gateman
"Tbh I'm glad they tried to go for the head and make it as quick as possible, that poor thing didn't deserve any of it or hell any of the animals in the movie for that matter. In fact one of the actors in that scene immediately cried after the shoot was done, no civilized person should be able to come out of that without having a few scars inside"
Didn’t the actors have to show up to the court room so they could prove they didn’t die💀
"I hate the gore and that entire aspect but I actually think this movie is pretty genius in the manner it portrays it’s story, very underrated actual story and direction."
"3:45 I would not go as far as to say the killing of these animals were ""unnecessary""
They were going to kill and eat them anyway. There's no Whole foods over there, so they kill and eat just about anything."
You tube is loaded with real life butchering animals
Love the movie. Entertaining watch. Very enjoyable scenes. One of the best comedies of the century. Very simple and straightforward with no weird extreme scenes that would turn me off. Would recommend as it deserves a G rating.
got my first bj to this film
your vids are really somthing 1 wish my stuff can be like yours maby not this one tho. sud
"I reckon that the vile production of the film flips the antagonist again. We rooted for the protagonist guy since he was exposing the vile production of this meta film, but we the viewers watched Cannibal Holocaust with its own vile production too, we are the antagonists, at least as soon as we engage and spread the film for it's grotesqueness without understanding the message."
I can watch some gory stuff if I know it's fake and staged and the actors that play as the gross deformed freaks or whatever crazy sycho is in the movie is a good loving person in real life but this shit was real? I hope the director is frying in hell right now
"I made the mistake of watching it, the turtle scene… I’m still scarred by that scene. I’m never watching it again, it’s tame in comparison to some other films I’ve seen. But the turtle goes on way too long."
"There are 3 other movies that might be more controversial. One is A Flower Of Flesh And Blood (Japanese) after Charlie Sheen was gifted a copy of the movie he reported it to the othorities convinced it was a snuff movie, there was a full inquiry into the movie and the director had to prove how the effects were actually done to clear his name.  The second in Men Behind The Sun, this movie was a chinese movie about the awful experiements commited against chinese and russian POW by the japanese in ww2. The movie featured actual human cadavers in disection scenes and animal killing as well. The third film is The Devils which is still banned and unreleased in its full uncut version."
I'm scared to see this movie.
It's very strange to me that people seem more bothered by the turtle killing than what very easily could have become mass killing of those indigenous folks in the burning building
i never knew the animal deaths were REAL omfg…
"I'm not even gonna watch this video but just give my opinion on it cause I get it. At the time it was shocking for ehat it was but I finally gave it a chance back in 2019 and it was just terrible. I mean the most we had to any crazy found footage was this film and then the faces of death series but man it was just dumb as fuck. Maybe cause I'm morbid I dint see it the way most do, and I'm sure some would agree with me. But it was more cringe than anything for me. I didn't give a shit about the animal killing scenes ever cause I get it....tribals and being in tribal land you gotta eat. Just a stupid ass film. A Serbian film was better cause it had more shock value and that movie was also boring as fuck."
"I remember when i was a about 7 years old after playing with my friends i went home and saw my dad watching this movie,my mom was currently sleeping in our bed (I sleep with my parents in the same bed when  i was a kid) so i decided to sit and watch it cuz idk movies it is,I was literally paranoid about joining my parent to visit my grandparents (on my mothers side) in the mountains (my grandparents live in a small community where my mom and her siblings were raised) the nightmares didn't help took me alot and i mean alot of time to get me to stop being scared.The reason my dad was watching this movie cuz back then my dad seems to watch horror movie frequently every time he relaxes on the couch nowadays he disturbed when he sees goree scene's in movies,idk why he doesn't watch his old movies now or horror movies in general.

Now i appreciate the movie."
Don't watch it. It's that simple. If you don't enjoy that sort of thing then don't watch it.  This idea we need to ban things we find uncomfortable or distasteful is pretty pathetic. This isn't up my wheelhouse but I'd watch it to see the fuss. I just don't let media offend me. The on/off button exists
The fact that you think the animal death was unnecessary proves you don’t understand the intention and message of the film.
Would like to hear you review “A Serbian Film”
"I’m 4 years too late, but as someone with an anthropology degree, I feel like we should have discussed this movie during my Ethnography and Archeology and the media courses"
"don’t forget a Serbian film, they had to go to court to prove that the rape scenes weren’t real."
I agree .
"A really interesting movie. These days it would be harder to shoot some of the animal scenes.
The rating on IMDb is understated 😐😐😐
From me 8/10."
"Its the Fact In Nature, animals (carnivores) Kill and eat eachother but in the modern eye people see it as Cruelity and yes we are carnivores-"
"Your boring, and dumb, and so is anyone of your Generation that can pallet this nonsense.... More self-righteous, millennial drivel.... I dread the future."
"Killing animals to make a trash movie is beyond cruel and evil. I rather the idiot director, production and dumb actors to die. Bye."
Check out carl yorkes real interview on the movie   not a lame excuse
Talk about not having your facts straight
For a real view of the film   check out the documentary on dvd or online
One of the greatest horror movies of that time    always got useless reviews
"If this movie was half as violent and had better acting, I think it would get a lot more praise."
"“My son was a son of a bitch” 
His wife: 😐"
4:12 perfect timing.
"Whilst I agree that animal cruelty never should've been included in this film, but why the hell is the UK bitching about animal cruelty in films when they're the ones that allowed animal farm, watership down and the plague dogs?"
"You live in a country famous for its whisky and you have Jack Daniel’s, widely considered garbage here in the country it’s made…"
I’ve seen FAR worse. Sucks about the animals tho. Still... I’d rather watch this than two Brazilian ladies eating........... you know what? I gotta go
"This film ain’t for everybody, and I think that’s  what made it appealing to me. Only thing I didn’t like was the anima deaths, but other than that I can appreciate this film for what it tries to do."
damn...
this film haunted me for years.i could not make the difference if its scripted or real.till this day.
last cannibal world
The animals in this film were great method actors
"I feel as if Cannibal Holocaust could have been a brilliant film if... The director wasn't such a hypocrite.

Things like murder, rape, violence are all powerful storytelling devices. You can depict representations of these things in a film, that's perfectly fine. But when you film violence against animals, and native people being put in potentially harmful positions... Then it's fucked up.

I probably still wouldn't watch the film if the production behind it wasn't so disgusting (I didn't watch The Human Centipede either), though. But I think it could have been very popular had it been more humanely produced"
Where'd this come from?
Good one
"I genuinely think that if it weren’t for the animal cruelty, this movie would be a cult classic. So many people can overlook the mistreatment of PoC (unfortunately) but gasp at and shame animal mistreatment (which I don’t disagree with, animal cruelty is awful, don’t get me wrong), so without that aspect, I can guarantee you that horror buffs would LOVE this movie for being gritty and “real” and having a social commentary,"
The film’s looks so real and gory which I like about the it but the animal killing was just 😳 even the scenes was just… I can’t.
movie is good and isnt that bad compared to a lot of other nasties and other exploitation films
I CANNOT believe they released this movie on bluray to buy....WITHOUT SUBTITLES. WTF!!!!!
Wait. The turtle killing was necessary. They had to eat... and they ate it.
"I finished watching the movie when I was 12 and couldn't sleep for 2 month, now I'm desensitized to snuff films."
was there originally a thumbnail with this?
The title doesn't cover the half of it!
I can’t hear that background music and not think of dankpods
"Watched the movie. The animal cruelty disgusted me past the point of any appreciation of the rest of the story. There was no need to do that to real animals, with the human bodies it was obvious they could have easily made prop animals and got roughly the same cinematic effect."
Dont forget Bear Grills has mutalated and killed many animals on screen for no reason
You do know how incredibly unnatural it is to be grossed out by an animal being killed? Pathetic .. you have no connection to nature
Well I thought it was a great movie.
"So if you felt the need to discuss this movie, when will you be discussing 2girls1cup?"
Watched it yesterday- what a masterpiece! Especially the contrast between the gore shots and that beautiful soundtrack 👌
"Three types of people those who love this movie, those who are indifferent about this movie and those who detest this movie

I love this movie"
"me after watching the movie ""HOLD ME Ryan Hollinger!!!!!"""
It wasn’t that bad actually
cant believe euphoria put the main theme from this movie in the show. this movie is so crazy
"I feel like a better filmmaker could have made the same movie, but without all the actual heinous stuff behind the scenes. The sooner we leave Auteur theory in the dustbin and stop giving these unimaginative bozos with one single deep thought the benefit of the doubt, the happier we will be."
Same with the monkey. They drained its blood to drink I think. And the tribe dude ate its head. It has a purpose. To eat.
Good thing we were high on weed because I barely remember this movie.
This film is the reason cry babies exist.
"Keeping extras in burning huts, and making fun of a woman who refused to go nude the background for the film I worse than the idea of the film"
Great take on this
The fact we're able to even know of its existence is questionable.
6:30 is that Jerry’s uncle Leo?
Lol the dialogue in this film is as blunt as a sledge hammer to the crotch
"4:52 - Not true, On the Silver Globe, 1977."
"Human centipede 1,2 and 3 ""am I a joke to you?"""
"I love this movie. Repugnant and hypocritical as it its creation might have been, it tells an absolutely great story with an incredibly uneasy atmosphere. Those animals deaths while cruel, really lend authenticity to the other deaths and cruel acts in the movie. I think this movie is art. While I hope no other movie like it is ever made again, I think it is a good thing that it exists."
"Several Safety Issues?

It's a miracle no one was mortally wounded."
"Cry Baby.... Death is just a part of life and people that have never killed their own dinner always wanna cry when animals are killed in films. Those animals have natural predators that kill them violently and eat them. I just find it as a virtue signal, people pretending they are some how affected by something or someone they have never knew of existence until a certain event occurs."
Why some people deny still nowadays the holocaust?
Here I am looking at this guy trying to figure out how I know him… he’s a classic porno star… 🤦🏼‍♀️
Art is subjective so they say
"Damn, this sounds like it could have been a good provocative movie if the creation process had just been more humane."
"I like music,soundtrack, not movie. Movie is horrible."
"There is nothing I can expect than doing what other people they thought its good for their taste. Some might be for money but this time, its for popularity to get more money"
They killed actual animals and tortured them that’s disturbing
"Other than the ethics on how the movie was made, I didn't hear a lot as to why the movie is bad. While I wish they hadn't used actual animals to kill, I think the movie succeeded in what it set out to do."
"lol this is the only horror movie i cant watch. every other one is light work, but this one i can never watch without skipping chunks of it."
Lmao your username tells me all I need to know about you. “Woke” lmfao how fucking cringe
"First off these animals were killed not to be eaten but to be in a movie, and secondly being concerned for animals is quite normal. People humanize everything just so happens that it's animals and that doesn't even excuse a giant pile of horrible shit the director did for this film"
Which animal did they torture? I watched the movie today and no animals were tortured. They all died quickly.
Barudibersikan bro
"The only thing controversial in this movie today is the animal killing.
You can watch far worse things on HBO"
The fact that they killed real animals makes it even better
"I remember watching this film in 2015 and being sick to my stomach with the turtle. I find it extremely hypocritical on the part of legislation that killing animals is prohibited from being SHOWN, not done. It is hypocritical of people to be appalled by animal deaths when they, in fact, eat dead animals every f*** day and making celebrations out of it.
Even Deodato himself commented on the animal cruelty charges: ""They don’t make the connection between the food on the table that mummy has cooked from the supermarket, and the fact the animal has actually been killed. When you go to a Third World country people kill animals. I saw pigs and rabbits being killed growing up on a country farm when I was young. My son has not seen this because times have changed, he hasn’t had the experiences I have, for him it all comes pre-packed.""
If even a cynical and exploitative person like Deodato can see more truth than most of us, why can't we?"
"OH I GET IT NOW
Fey's real name is Tina
Tina...Fey"
"you helped me love the movie more as a pure example of deep horror. No excuses here, just exponential evil reflected back on us about us"
https://youtu.be/_WyKYB4sg2Q How it feels rewatching this one
I watched this movie a few times. I had to fast forward through the animal killings. I actually really like the scene with the “Tree Tribe”.
The plot kind of reminds me of Night Crawler.
Thanks to Riz Ortolani
"This movie is hard to watch and justify with how it was produced. Even with that said, I appreciate us having a movie like this. It's because we can generally see this and go, 'yeah, that kind of thing is too far'. We have a good understanding of why it is too far and why we should not make a movie this way.

Asides from its, admittedly harsh production, the movie has an actually interesting story. The commentary it gives is great but the hypocrisy with its creation is difficult.
We do need extreme cinema to push boundaries (I'm sure y'all can think of a few) but we need to always keep movies like Cannibal Holocaust in mind for 'how not to make such art'.

I'm hopeful that boundary pushing art of all kinds can continue to be created but that we always look back at historical atrocities to improve such arts creation and not repeat mistakes."
"It's fucked up, but a one-of-a-kind of fucked up...

I think that's the best way to describe it."
"I think this is one of those movies that would be worth a remake, but only if the remake stayed as faithful to the original as possible and the special effects were just as good. If this was made ethically, with the input of the indigenous people involved and respect to those people and their land/belongings and no animal killing etc, then it might be more accessible to more people and more people would get exposed to the worthwhile messages of the film. I watch horror movies because I know that the actors and sets aren't actually suffering ( unless there's some very sad story about the making of the film). So if I know a film contains actual depictions of suffering, its extremely hard to want to watch. Documenteries are one thing, A person collected bits of history that we need to learn from. But making others suffer needlessly for a fictional film? ""Unethical art"" Thats gross abuse of those being made to suffer for the director's profit."
The vagina mutilation scene is the worst part to witness despite all the real animals harmed. That scene was gnarly af
I watched this movie when I was like 14 or 15 xD
When I saw it as a teenager I just thought it was a movie about gore nothing more...now I'm literally mindblow by all the underlying
Whatever this movie critics are at the end it was a good movie in my opinion
"It's a tough film to watch. But once seen, never forgotten!"
"It's not complicated friend, you simply saying that you don't want to like it instead of saying it is a good film or not, just keep repeating they killed a turtle, feels xD. Wow, that was the video, so.. thank you for taking my time."
"Animals, uhm.."
Oh man you’re so edgy and cool oh man you’re so tough wow cool man
I'm not being edgy. That word has lost all meaning thanks to being over used by idiots like you
 @genocyber4842  he got you to react. You lost.
"Thats...not how that works. Thanks, low iq individual"
"You’re a genuine idiot. The animals killed for food, are FOR FOOD, humans NEED food. this wasn’t for food, this was strictly for entertainment. The animals died for nothing. Use your brain kid."
" @genocyber4842  Hmmm, they ate the turtle later so it was food. You don't need to eat animals if you're hungry. What are you, 5?"
" @donp8136  the indigenous people ate ONE turtle, and not even for nutrient reasons. They’re also still stuck in the Stone Age. They’re a backwards civilization for a reason, you Buffon. The people who directed and produced the movie didn’t eat any of the animals. Which consisted of more than just a turtle. What else you got dumb-dumb."
This actually sounds way more interesting than I thought it would be. I may actually watch it.
probably shouldn’t be eating breakfast while watching this
"All these years later and I'm like, wait, was this doing something similar to ""Cuties""?"
The movie has a great deal of realism but other than that....... TRASH
This film would’ve aged much better if the director wasn’t such a terrible person. Animal cruelty and a lack of actor safety and consent have no place in art.
RIP those innocent animals but if you want to achieve something you have to sacrifice something. This film is a pure art the mother of all horror movies but it's not for everyone i repeat not for everyone.
"I absolutely hate this movie. Even though I know it's fake; but I despise the tone. And how horrible the main characters are. The idea that this film is commentary on the western world's ignorance and arrogance, while being ignorant and arrogant completely kills your argument. It's like the film ""Cuties"" it was supposed to be a film about the hyper sexualization of children while hypersexualizing children. You can't have both."
I’m either culturally ignorant or he straight sounds like the hybrid blend of British cross American...      or maybe he’s just Canadian
I refuse to watch this because of the animal cruelty and graphic r*pe. Thanks for watching this so I don’t have to.
This is one of those movies I can't watch because knowing what went in behind the scenes takes away from any positives the final product might include.
The theme music is stupid comfy though
"""Wow, this film looks and feels so real!""

""Yeah... real"""
https://youtu.be/HcHVxA3M0YY my full reaction to the movie
Solid video.
Check out my horror films reviews!
This movies good
A fairly interesting analisys that is unfortunately ruined by snowflakery.
"Idk, I may just be the wrong audience, but the purpose of horror shouldn't be to shock and disturb, but to discuss and deal with things that are shocking and disturbing.

From cautionary tales told to kids, to stories that deal with the horrors of the human existence and beyond, horror deals with terrible things. Canibal Homocaust seems to me like a genuine piece of clever and profound art, that has been stuffed so full of needless cruelty and shock value that it has ruined the movie like any meal composed 50% of ghost chilli peppers is ruined. Some people want the kick from horrors that burn themselves into your mind, but that's not art any more than a ghost chilli pepper is a meal; they can go togeather and one can even be crucial for the other.

I wish this story had been told resppnsably, I might have revered it, but instead I literally can't watch it and retain my mental health  so I'll n3ver get to see it beyond reading what it contains, and I gotta say I know I'm missing out.

 All the shock and gore is there in the way though, like some challenge to see how able you are to stomach suffering and abuses, which also attracts some of the worst ""fans"", who seem to think it's funny that they tear apart animals. I know decent people find stuff here too, but I don't think being able to watch this is an achievement, I think it's a shame, because we should be inclined to agressively resist stuff like this to make sure it doesn't happen in oir lives."
"Eli Roth's 'Green Inferno' is the Citizen Kane of cannibal movies compared with this vile piece of crap. I can't make it to the half hour mark, it's horrible."
some people just want to see the word burn...
"This is were you draw the line of what is ""snowflakery"", really?"
Oh man ur so edgy and cool oh man that username is so cool wow so tough man ur so cool
"Coppola showed the sacrificial slaughter of a bull in Apocalypse Now.  No one batted an eye.  

Deodata shows the killing of several animals taken for food, and everyone gets their panties in a wad.  

One was portrayed on film as tribal ritual, while the other was portrayed as sadistic cruelty.  It goes to show there we as a society have a problem with the portrayal more than we do with the act."
did no one see the us army KILLIN the PEOPLE
Feel like the movie itself coulda been great I think the movie is pretty good but ruined by what happened to make it
why did they have to kill the animals they could have used a fake one
"Cannibal holocaust is a brilliant peice of commentary even though it's hypocritical. The OTT nature was extremely necessary because if the movie was clearly made using special effects, and safety equipment and practical effects instead of real animals people would probably overlook it even more as just a shitty horror. And the fact that the tapes were destroyed, and the world never knew about the truth TRULY leaves the taste of rotting meat in your metaphorical mouth, not only did you have to stomach all that disgusting gore and sex but there wasn't even close to a happy ending. If you can stomach it go watch Cannibal Holcaust."
"A Serbian film 
Is the worst film I've ever had the displeasure of watching I wouldn't recommend it because of how much is wrong with it but if your up for a try not to get mad or vomit challenge go ahead 😂"
"It just stays with you bro, if know what you mean to call it artistic is a stretch. A snuff movie no but somewhere in between"
"The BBFC ended up ruling that to censor the animal deaths would be hypocritical because they were all clean, quick kills and they didn't censor the animal deaths in Apocalypse Now (which came out a year before) and El Topo which all went on the be cult classics."
"i think you absolutely should be a ""social justice warrior"" about this whatever that means

also the title of the film is fucked on its own wow holocaust isn't a synonym for genocide or however the movie means it even"
Proud of you for recognizing what could be for you!  Great job picking the exact right movie to propel your fame (also no irony).
I love the face that the shocked face meme keeps zooming in.
I recently watched this film. It was a tough watch and I have seen a lot of violence up close. As far as animal death is concerned I don't think it was necessary to tell the story and should not have been included. Other then that I think it told an interesting story with a horrifying outcome.
Did anyone get a torrent link for this movie?
"when i saw this for the first time, i didn’t believe that the animal deaths were real until the turtle scene. seeing them tear off that shell will scar you for life."
"Still haven't seen this movie, it's on my bucket list"
"The dialogue, themes, message honestly sound interesting but alas"
Never hurt animals.
Fun fact (not really): he wanted to film a scene where piranhas eat a guy but that didn't happen because he doesn't have a proper underwater camera and he can't train piranhas
So basicaly grosser Green Inferno?
Can you please make video on Brain Damage (1988) Movie?
I assume it's significantly cheaper.
Because this movie went big. It didn't go home.
 @an8strengthkobold360  oof
"That's the king of all disturbing movies. IMO. Like its not a good movie but its the most nasty.

The best disturbing movie is Martyrs though. The French movie. So good while also being gorey. Good story. Characters. Effects. Everything."
I honestly don't get how anyone could've thought this was real.
Great review. I am one year older than this film and saw it as a teen. I remember only the sensationalist elements of it so the social critique didn't land for me then or I forgot about it later. It's good to hear the disgusting backstory of the production though. I am glad films like this are unthinkable now.

The hardest parts to watch for me were definitely the animal scenes… this whole film was just crazy
"An actual burning hut? So wait, the filmmakers technically almost did what the 'filmmakere' in the film did?"
Wtf is that accent
"Watching Ryan using his hand gesture while he was doing his intro. I'm like ""Oooo...is he gonna knock over his drink""?"
"Fuuuuck another video of the controversy Behind the Movie? Shit man, can we get a rundown of the movie and then get your thoughts?"
i like the movie idc but what done is done it was made in late 70s- early 80s there nothing we can do now
"Fuck an Oscar. I want my special effects to be so good that I get a murder charge!
FOOKIN METAL!!!!!!!!!!!"
Seriously director should be awarded death penalty.
"It' s still shocking nowadays. A brilliant film, as good or even better than its direct predecessor, Deodato's ""Ultimo mondo cannibale"", which is an absolute masterpiece."
"you didnt review the acting, the editing, the directing, the cinematography or even the special effects. You make some interesting points but seem to forget to review the basic properties of the movie."
"This is my absolutely favorite movie of all-time, and I'll probably never watch it again. It's repulsive, violent, and unbelievably immoral. I do not like the animal killing either, folks. But it's still an incredible film. You really have to detach yourself when you watch it because Jesus fuck, man, it's a rough ride."
Cant even speak english properly.
"Hi 
:)"
Where is he from?
One of the few horror movies I'll never watch. I don't mind gore at all but the real animal deaths are just a big yikes. Not gonna support a movie like that.
Irish or British
"people legit couldve died in that burning hut

im surprised he was never charged"
jjvader it wasn't a stunt wtf.... Those were not stunt actors those were just unpaid actors throw into a burning hut with no way out... Are you okay? Do you seriously not know the difference?
"jjvader they did not consent to nearly being burnt alive without and safety precautions. They consented to playing natives in a film without pay. That's it 


😂 You can't be fucking serious dude"
Death penalty for almost harming someone on accident. That's pretty dumb.
"he isnt that kind of reviewer.
this isnt an english class film review"

I mean day of the dead is my favorite movie and i will watch it again and a guy gets his head ripped off
"Years later, the director said he regretted filming those scenes and wished he could take it all back....if only"
Can qomebody please tell me how i can watch this without pay?
"A strange type of a documentary.  However, this is not very far from most all of current TV (behind desk) and action (on scene) journalists.  This description also includes most all of the national printed 'news' material.  I thought 'news' was not supposed to be biased however most journalists are like ""Hi, Mommy, I am on TV, listen to what I can get by with saying""."
The movies main theme is amazing. Added it to my spotify.
"I don't know about the rest of you but the animal cruelty really led me to think more about not eating meat anymore. So, I guess that movie segment was really effective."
I got it on DVD.
Just gonna wait until Ryan reviews A Serbian Film...... seriously.
After a few mins of watching this video I went straight to 123movies got on discord and streamed the movie with a few buds. Had sum pretty good shock value. Get to see a dude shove mud up a womans puss puss. Average tuseday know wut im sain? 10/10 movie.
"Yeah, this movie is kind of nauseating. Not a big fan. Out of all the cannibal boom movies, I like Cannibal Apocalypse the most."
"""some lunatics in Germany.."" bruh! I am offended!  Wait, wait...nah I'm not. :D You're not wrong after all, lol. I mean have you seen ""Nekromantik"". Damn, you would have a great time talking to Jörg Buttgereit :)"

"Need to watch this movie now because last year's there was not even one movie that made me scared, laugh or feel discussed ... Only disappointments"
"I obviously don’t agree with anything that happened behind the scenes, but I actually liked this movie a fair bit. I also think the calming main theme kinda works in the film’s favour- just because it enabled me to take the last few minutes as a darkly comedic satire as opposed to an exploitation horror."
"Everytime I see parts of this movie, I literally get nauseous."
Tell me practical effects don't look better than c.g.i. this man got a damm murder charge for how REAL these effects look. Now that's a real professional right there practical effects are REAL life and thier always going to look more authentic when done right.
Omg I just watched this movie......WTF!!!!!!!!

I had to do a project in middle school about the actual Holocaust so I googled “holocaust” on google images in class and the first result was the girl on the spike. I don’t think I finished the project but I’m sure I made whoever was monitoring the class computers very uncomfy.

ik this video was posted a long time ago and you might already do this in at the present but it's best to list out the possible triggers even just in the description or comments. Cause scenes of suicide can make it so I cant work or focus on anything for the rest of the day but I dont want to miss out on videos that have things that arent triggering for me
I still have a tape of 1984 of this picture. We all thought it was a true documentary and know I now it was just an ordinary production.  Thirty years and now I know is a fake....it lasted more than Santa Claus.😱😱🤥🤥
we live in such a pussfied society
this movie could’ve been a classic if it wasn’t so horrific and maybe took inspiration from jungle films like apocalypse now.

"Is funny that nearly everybody who watched this movie complains [with good reason] about the unnecessary killing of the animals just for shock value. But yeah... is a good movie but the director messed up so much abusing it, one way or another, nearly everybody who appears on the screen."

As if this movie isnt happening in real life lol
"“This film is banned within over 40 countries.”

YouTube: B U Y O R R E N T"
"I watched this video multiple times, thinking ""oh it's probably fucked but how bad could it be"". Then I watched the thing. It's ... almost physically painful to watch, especially the back half, where you're following the lost crew's tapes. The lack of closure due to how the film is concluded leaves you feeling barren inside, and I just couldn't stop thinking about what all I'd seen. I think that may be one of the most repugnant things about this film to me; I have no closure for the attrocities it presents, so now my soul wants to go back and see it again to try to find some kind of reason, even though I know it isn't there. Damn this film."
The animal deaths are fucked up except for the tarantula fuck those and we should kill more of them and replace them with robots or something 😒
Music was great.
Great film
"There was this episode, like the Hitchhiker, where an artist turned women into statues by sticking them with a spike.  In the end, he was turned into a statue.  Do you know the show and episode?"

This movie is not that bad. Fireday the 13 is a lot worse. I still love them.
Every horror movie directors dream
"Hate this film. Not because it’s scary but because real animals died in painful, brutal ways on screen. Disgusting."
Very good insight to a film that will always divide debate. But great work by it's presenter.
"Page Not Found I live in the USA and this film was banned here, but I still shows buy or rent because of the ban lift"
It's free on Facebook
Page Not Found the movie is the censored version without animal cruelty.
 @stroervor  no it’s not?
 @georgegershwin327  the one on YouTube but if ur on the us u can still see the uncensored one the one with them killing the turtle(I believe)
 @paddedpineappleanimations265  it's not banned in the US
" @paddedpineappleanimations265  Never banned in the US. It was released to theaters in the Northeast US in 1980, but took a long time to be available on video. I had to buy a bootleg VHS from the Dutch laserdisc in 1995."
 @brendagalvez4982  yes it is. Lemme explain: a bunch of movies are reuploaded on Facebook all the time at a good quality and are basically never taken down. So yes the movie is free on facebook
"This movie is unwatchable and beyond vile, I feel for the animals and the actors tortured to make it. Even watching this breakdown is hard."
"Sorry, I thought this was a truly extraordinary film - okay, not subtle, but it is extremely innovative and more intelligent than almost every horror film. Say what you will about it, but it certainly isn't 'throwaway'.

Yes, the killing of the animals is horrifying, but I felt a lot more sorry for the Yacumo tribe (yes, I know it's just a movie...)"

"3:15-3:35 was one of the best things I’ve ever seen. I cringed a deeper cringe than I thought was possible. I felt like I was falling into a pit of despair. In hysterics with laughter while genuinely crying for the wounded soul who is the Makeup Man.
You are a fantastic writer. Keep this up! So glad I found your channel!! Love your style man. Thanks for the awesome content 😊"
Acting 👌
Wow this is unexpectedly sad
"This,,, made me really emotional?? I laughed but also had to pause and remind myself it's fictional"
He deserves so much more credit wth he's hilarious
That Jim Carey quote hit deep

You can have the hard boiled egg from last week
"Love your videos bro, keep it up. Stay on the grind👌💪🏻"
Your a god tier human like idk how you don’t have over a mill subs

 @slade7931  no
Yes a SA G
2:35 am and I'm planning on watching JablenskiGames from start to the recent episodes
"Actually, there are gaming videos all the time. All the video content Jack Black creates are one big game and also he shows us many many different games exist (the games beyond the world in our monitors, TV screens), if only we are creative and enjoy the life with our closest members, friends fully as one joyful game. I like this concept a lot. Great videos Mr Black. With my mother are still watching your amazing movie The School OF Rock. It has become classic. You are a very inspiring film actor, human being! All the best to you. Take care of you in this Corona time. I also subscribed to your channel and I am following all the news about your new content, new YOUTUBE videos. You beat Ninja and your colleague Will Smith too, oh yeah, you are the best Mr. Jablinski!"
Jack u missed an f-word form that fake ninja it was the last one he said
Ahahaha that beginning 😆👍
using dollar bil$$ as a bookmark
Is it me or does jablinski look like jack black? Freaking amazing.
Imagine if he leaked his email
he's mad that his baby was on fire
I wonder how many fans notice him daily or weekly
Woot woot love ya Jack Black!!!!! Ur freakin awesome dawg!!!!!!!!!!!
Did Ninja just do a Highlander reference
I was so happy to see it was the real ninja ✊🏾😂
"After 90 seconds I had to accept a man twice my age knows more about youth culture than me.
I'll watch something else"
No gaming videos this year
If he released this video in Feb 2020 instead of Feb 2019 he'd be thrown in biohazard isolation by now...  :o     1:50
Hahaha at the meditation zoom out
"The clip of your hand up, had me kinda mad, people have zero Culture if they don’t know who Jack Black is"
why have the Die Antwoord fans not found this yet??
My first Jack Black movie was Shallow Hal when I was a teen. I have to catch up with his new movies.  I'm a fan of Jack Black always have been ever since I was a teen. Still am I'm 33 and I'm a fan of tenacious D. Does anyone know if Jack has a gamertag on x box?
this mans beard is to old for his soul
why did jack black grow a beard?
The adults are more hyper in gaming than the kids
"HA, I was NOT expecting that Ninja"
"we don't play , we shoot 😂"
Did he say he has a fever. CORONA VIRUS
Still waiting on those game videos Jablinsky. Come on now...
Those kids have a lucky dad
"Y r these videos so disliked, it’s probably just cause he’s a famous actor"
Somebody hacked my YouTube channel long time ago and now I'm finally back on my YouTube channel I had to pretty much set everything up all over again and I would love for me to be a fan of your YouTube channel if you can give me a shout out if you can that be awesome I do movie reviews on trailers I do reaction videos on trailers anything all film I react to it so if you can give me a shout out that be awesome my YouTube name is brayton movies.

-I'm the Weirdo with the Beardo but hot damn you are too"
"It's what I was telling Markiplier... Arcade shooter, who the hell calls it ""shoot Em up?""

The south did not create arcade shooters.... Atari did then the arcade which omg.... Was holding a bunch of Atari functioning games..."

LMAOOOOO THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING EVER
the casual money bookmark
"You know how to pick your games. Senet is ancient stuff. They used to use 4 sticks as a counter instead of dice.  Depending on how many black or white sides are up,  you get 1,2,3,4 or 6 steps (that's right, there's no 5) 
1 white side up = 1 point/step. 
2 white side up = 2
3 white side up = 3
4 white side up = 4
4 black sides up = 6
Me and a friend played this ""Game of slaves"" for hours and days ^^"

https://youtu.be/WZskjLq040I
"Just only play arcade games , that still counts."
bro from chapie
Jebaited by the jb
I'm hoping that ninja actually stars in one of his videos...
Those people pretending not to be fans were probably hired by Ninja
Was that the guys from chappie?
I'm screaming
The facial cascade that is rocking in the clip is worthy of it's own MYTHOS.F'ing ROCK
The ninja bit had me dying
"4:10 I'd like to see a pterodactyl livestream.  Jables doesn't know it yet, but that's his final form."
epic
"I only knew of this channel because of mediexcalibur2012
Like if you also got that to happen to you"
"""don't make me do something stupid,"".... too late. wtf are those tattoos under your eyes"
When jack clickbaits u twice

Ninja sucks! Nick Eh 30 is much better
You can meditate I'll bongidate
Wasn’t this guy in chappie?
If only he was a jojo
There is only one ninja
Eyes open meditation!? That’s next level Jables! Be careful..
Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
Playing on 2x speed concentrates the insanity.
i love jack black
"Your kids live on their phone. Makes it very difficult to get them interested in anything. Hey son there's an alien invasion happening.

What? Oh that's nice."
Dinos at tttwwaaaaaa! 😂
His video production is going off the charts!!!!
"The gaming we thought would happen will never happen. Instead, we will get quality content that is more interactive and fun rather than people crying over ''kills'' and bluddy blow bleh kler poo."
Is that the guy from chappie? Who was also ninja
"This is the greatest channel I have ever seen
I needed this in my life, only one bad part
1 episode per week!!!!!!!!!!!"
👌
Brooo he said my last nameeee
heh
LOL NINJA
"nO GAMING VIDEOS THIS WEEK..... ""AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"" xD"
Ive got the behind the scenes on this video. Should I upload it?! Where Jack black sends Ninja a video asking him to do this with him. Let me know and I’ll upload and drop the link here
and what will you do now that Ninja has been accused with some serious bad stuff?
Tumbleweed Jack 💪🏻
"It would be cool I the body wall was branded Twister, and you had to hit the lights in the order they appear, and do simultanaety of different body parts, all at once."
do you fancy trying warframe ? its rather good!!
BABA
This is great!!!  Papa Jablinski!!
Dude wearing a kfc bucket on his head
OMG NINJA!!! LMAO!
Ninja from DA
Cut your Beard
Awesome Jack  ! Love the channel !
7:37 he uses money as a bookmark xD
And Die Antwoord.
"That accusation’s gone on before this video was uploaded. There’s a lot of evidence it was faked, more than it happened. Ninja’s whole thing is part of the Zef culture that’s based on trashy stuff. He’s not an actual trashy person himself."
"Meditation and media overload are so often mentioned in the same breath, although they are opposite things."

 @isaq_247  callao
jack black your awesome!
Jack. You're a fucking genius bro
“Using his balls for break” 🤣
He technically played a videogame in this one
why always 4.2k dislikes
Why is it that the kids are never amused by pop’s amazing anecdotes? “Dad your so lame” I spelled your wrong.
Jahblenskee Gahhmms
is this the one of Antwoord?
click bait
Fatty fatty boom boom
Nice beat saber
Good Stuff Bruh : )
That guy looks like the guy from chappie
Jack black the master troll
I love how much effort is put into these :P
these kids are too spoiled xd btw looking at all these children/teens now makes me think is this is how it's going to be like when all the adults are gone ? people just looking down on their phone all day everyday in public ? i don't want to live in this generation
Your temp was 999 wait what you would be melted by then huh
Unfollow! i like Jack Black more.. is he your brother? xD
"Didn't Die Antwoord just get accused of rape, and posting revenge porn of the girl he (ninja) raped? I hear the victim has a serious stack of evidence. DM's, text conversations, all dated and documented."
My new favorite channel and its not even close
yes
What a memester
Lol the funniest vid so far
How could you not like jackblack
this channel sucks.
4:39 🤣🤣🤣
Jack Black still looks like my dad except with more beard.
You may have Ninja respond but week 7 of no gaming

Gamer level 1000
Boronosaurus burger :).  I hope that’s a Eddie Murphy reference.     It’s still funny.
4:39
Is that the guy from chappy
he is that guy from Hollywood and a millionaire
Ninja sounds like a british person trying to do an indian accent
Fortnite. ..ewe.  Get on some REAL shiz.  Get on some apex
If I ran into JB in an arcade I'd be liable to shit my britchez
Ninja from chapie VS Fortnite Ninja
Lol jack is actually perfect as a YouTuber. His personality fits and the editing is hilarious.
Wrong Ninja!!! LMAO
Haha
"Change the profile pic…
He betrayed us"
Yaaaaaaaaa die antwoord!
Ninja is very noob
how did that ninja know it was jack black
I hope that JablinskiGames meets Jack Black someday that would be so epic
I've watched Ninja's response like ten times. Hope he's in Chappy 2 if they make it.
"pterodactyl part got me laughing like crazy, we really don’t deserve Jablinski Games"
q
Dieantwood lol
The kids hate him
So this is what a failed comedian looks like?
"not gonna lie, your skinall game is bad af."
"Tfue is the best Fortnite player btw, not Ninja. Ninja is the best at screaming and annoying people smh"
He's very talented! I love Tenacious D still and i always will lol.
METALLICA ROCKS Jack black is on his album they are great friends
r/woooooooosh
G H 🤔 shitty.
 @unhing3d121  I saw that 😫
"Joe Lea nah he isn’t. There’s no evidence that she didn’t consent and she didn’t get kidnapped, she bought the plane ticket to meet him"
Wait isn't this technically clickbait
CHAPPY IS A GOOD BOY

"5:30 This channels makes me wish to have a father growing up... but if it's not Jack Black, then maybe nah..."
"""Samuel Jason Black"" papashark's name is soooo close to becoming a bad mothafuqueur."
What the hell is a Del Gato though? Seriously?
DAS HAT
6:10 Meditation? I do that everyday in math class.
6:13 Adam the Woo confirmed
Glad to see the classic human condition of “dad embarrassing kids by existing” still rings true for celebrities.
I had that joke about two ninjas he took it from me
proof that fortnite rots everyone's brains
Love it all
Love him so much
Jack Black is a national treasure
Im actually looking forward to “no gaming videos this week” loll

FOR DA MEMES LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Awesome talk through of your painting
it looks just like the game at 1080p without TAA sharpening
I love this unique idea. Please do more.
"Absolutely love love love this. Thank you ❤️
Please do make more landscape process videos..."
This is EXACTLY the kind of content I have been looking for thank you so much for making this video 🙏🏼
"Thanks, good job. Love the way you set up your painting surface and the scene to be painted. Please do more like this."
"Thank you so much for this amazing video!! There are so many speed paining videos out there that don't give much instruction which doesn't really help. But this was beyond informative!! I just bought my first guoach set and got so intimidated. Your video has helped tremendously!! 

I also looooooove red dead!! Lol my husband and I always stop to enjoy the amazing scenery in the game. 😁

Quick question for you. Is there a reason why you use the bright pink primer versus a plain white?"
"This was so informative! Fabulous idea as well, specially for those of us living in... less than inspiring landscape regions."
very interesting and really good explained
Please make more! And talk the way you did in this one. It was really calming and i loved to watch it! ❤️
What an awesome idea! Thank you for sharing this!
"So happy to have stumbled onto your channel today. Beautiful painting, very helpful to see the way you approach layering colors. As primarily a watercolor artist I sometimes struggle to switch gears for opaque mediums like gouache. I look forward to seeing more of your work :)"
Love RDR2 and I love painting...never thought about doing this...but now I may! Great idea and great job!
This is so clever!
Loved watching and listening to you talk through this! Very excellent
amazing explanation :) love these kind of videos by you!
This looks amazing 😍I would love to see you drawing a scene out of Hobbit. For example the auenland
How do u shoot during quarantine?? I really wanna know ..pls make a video for that or can u pls reply..how donuts shoot  while painting??
"Hii I really like your arts, I already subscribed to your channel 🍀
Can you also sub to me I have also art videos on my channel, 
artist needs to be support other artists"
Can you do the highlights on the mountain before you do the foreground or is it best to do it last like you did? Beautiful work!
Thank you howard! I do plan on making more videos like this one very soon :)
"Thank you, that makes me happy, I try to make my videos as informative as I can :)

And yes, I often start with a colored underpaining, it's often yellow ochre or burnt sienna, but sometimes I go with other colors (like this bright pink). There are a few reasons: 

- having something in front of you rather than just a blank page makes it less daunting to start painting

- it forces you to use more opaque paint in order to cover the underpainting

- it makes it easier to gauge your values and colors than white does (white next to any color will make that color appear darker and more desaturated, this makes the colors look more like what they actually look like)

- and finally, it shows through in those parts of the painting where the paint isn't evenly applied, which just adds pops of color variation and makes the painting more pleasing than having dots of white showing up here and there

- ok one more, if you're painting outdoors it makes it so the bright outdoor light doesn't blind you when you're looking at the empty surface you're painting on

Hope that helps!"
"Thanks! There's really no right or wrong, especially with gouache since you can easily paint on top of dry paint. I did it last mostly because I like leaving the small details for last AND because I tend to jump around the frame so I can work on areas where the paint isn't wet yet. But yeah either way works, the only thing I'd avoid is painting something before painting something behind it. Example, if those pine trees covered the mountain, it would be easier to completely paint the mountain first, then add the trees, that way you don't have to paint the mountain while trying to avoid the trees you've already painted in front of it. Again, it can be done, it's just easier to do it that way."
Painting and Read Dead Redemption 2 are two of my favourite things in the world! I love this video. Im going to do some scenes from RDR2 myself now! The scenery is perfect! Thank you!!
I would love to see you paint any skyrim landscape like blackreach or ancestor glade!
I hope there's more of this to come! Your style is wonderful
"Thank you for so many tips!! The painting looks awesome 👏 love this idea of painting game scenes, can’t wait to see more 😍"
"i would definitely love to see more of these!! especially for Ori and the Blind Forest, Breath of the Wild, and Skyrim!"
"Love it! I am trying to learn how to paint and I try to paint screenshots from games I've played, with the end goal a kind of history book. I think the length of your video is good and it helps with understanding when you explain your thoughts and processes. Looking forward to your next virtual plenaire and in the meantime I might try my own virtual plenaire. Ty"
Very impressive!
Love this! Such a beautiful painting and everything is so well explained. So many good tips in this video that I'm going to have to try out. Thanks for an amazing video.
😍😍😍 beautiful!
"government: ""you can not go outside, not even for wholesome landscape painting""
sktchup: ""bet"""
Bravo. Thanks for that. I enjoyed it.
This is so impressive and brilliantly explained.....best I’ve seen in a long time.
Beautiful painting and see your process is very interesting.
I just love nature paintings they bringing some sort of feeling like calm and peace and quiet
I love this 😍
"A big THANK YOU.  Helping the global community with these relaxing, educational, and inspiring videos in the current SARS-COVID19 pandemia is commendable: I am aware of the extra work it takes to st up, film, edit, create and post a video. 
Please STAY SAFE, healthy and accept my praise and best wishes for you and your family!  
I think the explanations and length were perfect.  I have some questions:
IS there a reason you started with the bright pink background?  Would it have been different with a yellow warmer ocher instead? What is your horse's name?   Would you try a painting with your horse in the landscape?"
"i LOVE this!!! RDR2 is my favourite open world game of all time, and i feel like this didnt just capture the art of the game, but the feelings and emotions that i get while just.. staring off into the horizon in-game. great job!!! i'll be looking forward to more content :)"
"This was both helpful and fun to watch. I really need to learn how to draw though, but whenever I draw, I automatically lose interest. Do you have any tips to overcome this or, is liking the process of drawing an acquired taste sort?"
Nice work! Keep it up!
"Wow ! Came from your reddit post and must say , that this is really awesome ! Just wanted to know : How does it look for you ? 

Hope this will be a series :)"
"Right?! I spend most of my time just staring at the screen and going ""man this game is so beautiful"" and then I get mauled by a bear. But it's worth it 😄"
sktchup exactly what I do! “Look at this eh! Look at this!!” I’ve completed the story line and now I’m just running around collecting everything and trying to get my 100% overall completion. I’m at 94% it’s taking forever!xx
There definitely will be! I think the next one might be Skyrim :)
"Thanks so much, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed and thought it was helpful! I'll be making more like this one, hopefully with even better and more streamlined commentary :)"
Thank you!!
Lmao modern problems require modern solutions
sktchup hahaha the hero we NEED
Thanks! I'm glad you did :)
Thank you! Makes me happy to hear that :)
"Thank you, happy you enjoyed it :)"
"I agree, that's why they're pretty much all I ever paint lol"
 @dadozilla  in my art class I just got you out like mountains and stuff to keep me calm
Thank you :)
"Thank you, I'm glad you think so! I know the feeling, I went through that too and it's actually the reason why it took me a good 4-5 attempts at getting into drawing/painting before I actually stuck with it, each of the attempts that came before failed in a matter of weeks. I could write pages about ways to overcome that feeling, but it's actually part of a video I've been working on (I can't tell you how often I get a similar question) so keep an eye out and I think I might have a few answers for you soon :)

That said, the first thing that came to mind is that maybe you feel like your skills aren't on par with the kind of art you want to create, so drawing becomes a chore because you feel like everything you do will end up a failure anyway. If that sounds familiar, check out this comment I left on an art related subreddit a little while ago, I think part of it may apply to your situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/fgh7kj/_/fk59ndu

And again, stay tuned for that video, I can't guarantee it will fix the issue, but you never know! I'll try to get it done asap :)"
"Thank you! It will definitely be a series :) I was very happy with the finished piece, there are some things here and there that I realized weren't done ""right"" (the flowers could've been more saturated, trees on the left less dark for example) but overall I really like how it turned out. As for the video, I wish I had streamlined the process more because editing this was a nightmare lol but I know from experience that it takes a few tries before learning how to record things in a way that makes the process easier."
"Such a cool idea for virtual plain air lol, I think I can actually convince my husband to pick up a brush if I can incorporate video games into it!  I love the colors of the trees in the foreground."
"Beautiful painting. It is nice to see your process, and I really like the idea of painting from video games."
"Stumbled across your video on Reddit by chance... I decided to take a look at the video you linked in the comments. At first I was like, “this seems interesting, maybe I’ll watch a couple minutes of it.” From there I was sucked and then the video ended as if no time had passed. Phenomenal work, can’t wait to see what you’ll do in the future."
"This is so awesome idea. Really interesting and fun to watch.


5:30 you talk about sun direction. That made me wonder if the landscape you are drawing is recorded loop or actual running game. I'm guessing the former, as you would otherwise struggle with in game time being too fast, which would cause sun direction to change too quickly.


Also I would love to see this in more games. The Last of Us would be awesome for its post apocalyptic sceneries, Far Cry 4 or Steep would be beautiful for drawing large, vast mountains."
Dogshit get better man I can do better in sleep
"It looks sooo good bro, its awesome"
"Beautiful! I'm always so inspired by the landscapes in video games so it was cool to see someone do this. I love the detail you went into, it was very useful. Thanks and stay well!!"
"Thanks so much! I follow you on Instagram and really appreciate your posts there, so I was super excited to find that you’re posting videos as well. I really liked the up close panning you did at the end to give a sense of how you achieved the detail without going overboard and nitpicking with a small brush. Please keep it up!"
"I love how this turned out and I love the idea! your tips were so helpful too, thank you! 👏"
Why did you painted the paper pink at first? 🤔
"Thanks! I'm glad you think so, I thought it would be a fun idea but wasn't sure others would think so too haha"
"That makes me so happy to hear, I was worrying it might be too long or feel like it was dragging on, so I'm glad it could actually keep you engaged! Thank you so much, glad you enjoyed it and I'll def be making more like it"
"Thank you! And you are correct, I did loop it because the weather and lighting conditions in this game change so fast that I would've had maybe 5-10 minutes to do the whole thing lol in games where things don't change much I'd love to actually keep the thing going so it's even closer to an actual plein air painting. Also those are great suggestions! I would love to do one from The Last of Us, it's such a pretty game"
Do it then.
Thank you! 🙏
"Thank you, I'm happy to hear you liked it and found it helpful! :)"
"Thank you! Yeah I've been uploading the occasional timelapse, but I've been wanting to start doing actual narrated videos and this is the first of many :) I'm glad you liked that part at the end, it was a last minute decision but I figured it would make it easier for people to get a good look at the painting."
Aw thank you! I'm so glad you liked it and found it helpful :)
"I like to prime my surfaces with some kind of color (usually an orange brown tone, sometimes bright pink) for a few reasons: 


one, it forces me use thicker paint in order to cover it up (I still tend to use my gouache too thin, so that helps me avoid that)


two, it gets rid of the white of the paper, which helps with gauging values/colors and makes starting the painting feel less intimidating than if I were looking at a blank canvas.


and three, probably the main reason, it peeks through those little areas where the paint isn't applied evenly and adds little bits of color variation that make the whole painting feel more vibrant"
" @dadozilla  Oh! That's so interesting, thank you so much I'll try to used this technique to see the results :3"
Ewww
Seems like someone before you to a dump almost all the way down..
too much piss in that slide..
Someone had dinner at taco bell then rode this.
quite a hike back if you want a second time
"Some say it is sand :)) :O
that sand would work like sand paper
she would be only half at the end"
I see the previous person to slide down had chili con carne for breakfast.
"DAE piss, amiright gais"
Was I the only one expecting a big ramp at the end?
"all the skidmark commends aside, isn't anyone wondering what she looks like?... she sounds kind cute ;)"
This is the world's largest Shit 'N Slide.
They really should have made it a darker color so those rust colored marks wouldn't show up. 
I watched this video set to twice the speed and I was like....whoa that's fast...supercruise!! :D
lol thats one long shit stain. Did clifford the red dog whip his entire ass on this slide?
that's the biggest skid mark I've seen in my life
Looks so fun!
Is that just my eyes or did the person before her forget to wear a tampon?
"I don't know man, I still think they shouldn't have let her slide over someone else's massive skidmarks."
I assume the brown skid marks are shit stains?
Now imagine a razor blade somewhere on the slide
urinal slip and slide!    Whoopoo! lol
"Haus2theRest This reminds me of a slasher movie which was set in a waterpark called ""The Pool"". . . Watch out for the blade jammed through the slide around the corner when you can't slow down!"
"Some say it is polluted water. If so that makes sense. Some say it is soap. If it is soap, why would they put in soap that makes it looks like sewage water?"
"More shit, more speed"
That's a lot of pee.....
Woo Poo!!!
Turd simulator 2015: sewer aqueduct DLC
I think I saw this water slide on a TV show
I prefer my waterslides with a little less urine of them
Seems boring to me...
is that yellow stuff grease?
What's with the random stream of piss?
"Great experience, totally worth the e.coli."
Откуда коричневые полосы вдоль всей горки? Неужели так страшно?
this was awkward
I can only see the huge skid of feeces
"The person before her, was so scared they shat theirselves"
This is how i travel to work everyday.
Of course it's Acton Park. Where else?
"When really excited riders say ""Oh, shit!"" it's apparently not because the ride is fun."
"average speed of 14mph. I don't think id want to go any faster over them bumps. Damn Also, pretty obvious its not dirty water."
I am guessing whoever shit him/herself flew out of the slide at 1:12.
maxandsyd14 It's mineral deposits from hard water. I get it too at home because I also have hard water. Can be fixed with a water softener system.
I just wanna know why the water is brown...
I liked the part where she said: WHOOHH AHH
"""The Worlds Largest Skidmark - Come one, Come all!""







P.s Not talking about NJ as a whole"
Close your eyes and watch the video
"Looks slow as shit, needs more speed.
If a chick doesn't scream like a chick, how will bruhs react?"
most annoying scream every tiny jump >.<
i thought it was poop stain from people sharting.
giant piss LOL
This vid sounds so dirty...lol
That is one loooong ass shit stain
Sweet...now which slide do they take to get back up?
Wow they made kim's pussy a water park #shade
No pussy jokes come on guys 
Okay...was somebody just shitting themselves the whole way down
I really hope the brown parts aren't collections of peoples body fat... Which is why you never share a bath.
"and now you must walk back to the top, where you parked your car."
Guys it iron from they water. These city folk just don't  get it...
world's longest skid mark
why does it look like someone took a shit all way down it? lol
whom ever peed their bathing suit while riding this slide needs to grow a pair...and hydrate
It's like a type of soap that makes the slide more slippery.
"MattMzansi It was made to be safe, If it went fast then the Slide would seriously hurt a person. It was made to be the longest Slip n Slide. Even though it isn't fast, It still is a record breaker."
r0xsp0rts 12  True story. People could die if it had any deeper dips or quicker sections.
O thats how deep it goes almost got lost
"They take you up in a chair lift, it is a ski resort in the winter"
"High Maintenance So are you ""skinny fat"" from no exercise in you high-maintenance lifestyle?"
Carson Thaler can you rephrase your question because it makes no fucking sense please
"I was taking a sarcastic crack at your profile name. 

Usually high maintenance people are ""show horses"" and not able to really care for themselves.

""Skinny Fat"" is where a high maintenance person is thinner, sure, but not fit and capable of doing much in the real world. 

But given your response, I'm pretty sure you aren't as daft as you have so far demonstrated... "
"Actually, I was just poking fun at your choice of avatar/alias. You , on the other hand are acting like you've got a stick ""up your arse""... 

go figure- it's a high maintenance thing ;-) "
ethr95awd Totally agree I was like that shit looks nasty as f
It's in New Jersey.  Polluted water supply.
i want it steeper. are those poop stains?
"This is the shittiest, most boring-looking water slide I've ever seen. Leave it to New Jersey to make something so crappy."
"Do women have to make a noise at EVERY fucking thing, like the Kung Fu movies where the guys make a sound after every kick, jump, and punch. Every little jump this woman had to yelp. ﻿"
That one 8 year old who shit himself the whole way down
"screams like a little bitch the whole way
""it was awesome im gonna go again"""
At first I thought Alien drone fly by on left side 1:19
that looks so gross
did someone shit the whole way down?
sorry everyone i took a giant piss and found these people sliding through it.
Яп прокатился
No its not
"I saw this on TV, I think it is in New Zealand"
I didn't know they moved it to NJ
BuckeyeBond Totally agree. It's definitely too slow and plain. Not to mention the shitty looking piss flavoured water. That finish was so disappointing also.
It would be a lot better if you were actually there.
BuckeyeBond  Slow as SHIT. I need it to be as fast as the slide that I lost my two front teeth on...
MattMzansi Wow so hardcore teach pls
"BuckeyeBond Actually, this water slide wasn't made in New Jersey. It was made in New Zealand for a fundraiser called Live More Awesome."
"Sniper1286 Ok, leave it to New Jersey to want something so shitty from another country."
"BuckeyeBond The problem is the hill they put it on - if it were on a hill closer to the heart of the water park, it'd be farther from the chairlifts, but boy would you go FAST, as that slope gets kinds steep.  :D"
Rúben Guerra lol
***** You're right. Riding down a piss-filled slide at 2 miles per hour for like 10 minutes sure sounds fun!
"BuckeyeBond * actually, it's a minute and a half at 30-40 MPH, and the slide's dirt most likely occurred during the transport (seeing as it apparently didn't have it before transport, and during the assembly in Vernon, it seemed to gain that rusty dirty color."
"1,975 feet divided by 117 seconds (0:05 to 1:22 on the video) is 16.9 feet per second, or 11.5 mph.

Most rides are slower than you might think.  40 mph on a commercial water park slide is flying."
"ChillsandThrills First off I do agree with you on this video. That was very annoying. In karate/ kung fu it's totally different. Making noises is a part of the martial art. It makes people less confident in fighting you. That's exactly why Bruce Lee always made those sounds when fighting people. It would make them feel ""off-guard""."
Samuel Loshark wow didn't know that
"ChillsandThrills
Sarcasm or not?"
"Samuel Loshark I'm serious, especially about the Bruce Lee part"
"Samuel Loshark bruce lee was more of an actor than an actual fighter. Not saying he was a bad fighter, obviously he was good... but people seem to think that Chuck Norris is more of an actor and Bruce Lee more of a fighter when it's actually the other way around lol :D"
"*****
True, but the techniques used were correct. The noises weren't for comedy. They actually teach you to do that. Not as dramatic as Bruce Lee's noises. but that's because he was an actor."
Samuel Loshark yeah i know. I trained karate for 6 years. Yelling out from your guts is a part of martial arts. Represents your qi.
"She's enjoying herself, what's wrong with you? Don't like girls?"
Kitty Meow lol
"Haha,kinda does look like a drone at first!"
snazzy Mud before the slide ?
"snazzy Probably blood from their period, it's cheap and reduces friction by up to 80%. trust me i'm a cook"
tantan tan that was my second guess
snazzy The slide scared the shit out of them.
Come to piss park in nj
lockdown172 why is ur piss brown drink some water

Plot twist: The 2 subscribers were his mom and dad
😂 An absolute artist
I joined a stream and donated 2 bucks and got 17 subs yay
congrats
You legend.
I’m waiting for your paper play button unboxing video
Josh 😂💀😂💀😂💀💀😂😂💀😂💀💀😂
WHAAAATT???? NOOOOOOOO. Of course not.
"You're going to make me cry of happiness again. Thank you, Nataly."
Thank you very much. 😭😭😭
That's a great idea. It's coming. Also love your critique! Thank you.
"I know I say it to you all the time, but you truly appreciate real artistry. Thank you."
Quite an interesting video but for good part of the video I felt really distracted by how he wobbles his head so much.
"I've always found it interesting that in the US, engine displacement is measured in liters while fuel is sold in gallons."
Why? Because Americans are stupid. I mean look at them: they elected donnie chump as their president. There are those Americans that believe that Americans invented the SAE system and the Imperial system. They didn’t.
India is same as Canada except for weight. For weight we always use metric system. But for height and area of the house we use feet and sqft. For distances we use kilometer.
"Idk why you’d want to calculate a meter through the speed of light as apposed to  physical object lol

Like light can go around the world many times a second but I guess it works just feels way harder"
"If a Briton is driving down the motorway and they are told how many kilometres left they have to drive, they will typically convert this into miles and determine the time it will take them using their speed in miles per hour, rather than concert their speed into kilometres per hour and use this to determine the time it will take them when given a distance in kilometres. Perhaps that reveals something about how comfortable we are with different kinds of measurements: as a nation, certain dimensions (i.e. length, speed, time, mass etc.) have been more successfully switched to the metric system and we are more comfortable with switching between different systems of measurement in certain dimensions."
I think most Americans also flip flop between the two systems. Like when I’m drinking water I say liters and ml. Idk maybe that’s just me but
"For anyone wondering, that ""iron bar"" reference meter is really at platinum/iridium alloy.  Unfortunately, none of these materials are perfectly stable because they're real objects in our universe."
"couple of years old video, I know, but from my experience I genuinly think Imperial might go extinct naturally in the UK. its barely taught in schools (or atleast I never really learned it when I went a few decades back) and most people I know default to metric units.

Pints in pubs will always be an exception but thats almost more cultural than anything."
"thats the best explainer ever or the uks use of metric lol. we are mostly metric but some things are Imperial. with every generation they are more and more metric. my age group only really uses feet and inchs for hight and 🍆 size. stone is exclusively for a person's weight and tons for cars.. that's it. 

we do stubbenly hole onto miles tho. 


we never use °f tho. only a ever °c now"
14:06 is that 20 shekel as a bookmark??
The metric system has not put a man on the moon yet. NASA and Apollo was not metric yet in 1969. But they will with Artemis.
"Thanks to the lazy, my students in Oregon have to learn 2 completely separate measurement systems. And thus they never master one. It is a real problem."
"In the Seventies, Stewart Brand and friends associated with his Whole Earth Catalog fought metrification with a group called End Metric Madness."
"This video generally seems to lack any awareness of what neutrality and rationality meant with regards to the Metric system, which I suppose makes sense for someone with no real understanding of science or engineering. It also seems to be unaware of how product labels and sizes are affected by us being in a free trade zone with the US, which I suppose makes sense for someone with no real understanding of economics or trade. It also glosses over Metric's inconsistent appearance in construction and plumbing and the like, where it occasionally makes an appearance. It also would have been appropriate to refer to the strong age correlations. Where this seems to reflect a fairly gen-x sort of view, I don't know a single millennial or younger that knows what anything in Fahrenheit means, and its use with ovens is just ""that's the number it says in the recipe/on the box"". Similarly, with fluid units, and miles more generally. I would argue that mile now means ""some large distance"" in the dialects spoken by younger Canadians. I also know a lot of people that use pounds and feet/inches exclusively for body measurements, and estimate weights & distances in other contexts in metric. It might also have been interesting to talk about the trope of Canadians using Fahrenheit for pool temperatures, which I have never seen, and I suspect is an Ontario or western Canada thing? Largely I suppose I am saying that this could have used some acknowledgement of all the nuance, or any evidence of understanding behind the core goals of metrication, regarding rational and consistent standards in science and trade, which have largely been accomplished for decades."
"The rulers i've bought have always been in cm here in sweden at least, however the point of the metric system is that it really doesn't matter which one you use, they're technically both metersticks, just different divisions of it
If I'm measuring something and it ends up as 22,4cm, I would just say it's 224mm without even thinking about it
But you're correct that in professional situations, the mm is more common since you can skip the comma and it works well with both big and small numbers. 
For example, if I go to ikea to buy a door, it might say the dimensions are 2000x750x25, but noone reading that would say their door is 2000mm tall, they'd just say 2 meters, likewise, noone would say the door is 750mm wide or 0,75meters wide, they'd say 75cm or maybe 7,5dm but I doubt it"
"For all you anti-metric types out there, Quick! What's half of 9 3/16 inches?"
"Waitwaitwait. your measuring tapes only have inches? I'm American. Every measuring tape I've seen has inches on one side, and centimeters on the other side. Rulers too!"
"Nice video, but your arguments are flawed about which system ""makes more sense"". It's definitely not like languages, because imperial has a constant need of doing lots of calculation to convert from inches to feet to miles with no logic in it."
"Metric is clearly much easier to use, and far superior. Besides that, cultural roots are very difficult to change, so unless you work in science if you live in Canada, as you said, you will use imperial."
"It is more accurate to say that engine displacement is marketed in liters, because the figures given are only approximate.  I expect the switch came about because two digits suffice for an estimate which is close enough to be useful.  The specification sheet will give both US and Metric units.  My 2.5 liter engine is more precisely designated as 150 cu in, but I have no idea which units were used when the engine was designed.  

In any case, fuel volume and engine displacement are entirely separate things.  We don’t do anything with our displacement number but compare it to other engines, except that we can usually guess how many cylinders there are from the displacement in liters: 2.0 L is a 4-cylinder; 3.0 L is a 6-cylinder; 5.0 L is a V-8.  My 2.5 L is a large four.  With fuel volume we compute fuel economy.  We want miles per gallon, not miles per liter.  Now that would be odd."
A physical object is not stable.  The master standard meter had to be handled in order to use it to manufacture 2nd generation standards.  The precision of modern measurement is sufficient to show variation in the lengths of physical standard meters.
"In fact, the guidance for Apollo was done in Metric units, although Customary units were displayed to the astronauts."
"I was schooled in Oregon and mastered both US Customary and Metric units long ago without difficulty.  If you are a teacher in Oregon and your students can’t manage it, the problem is elsewhere.  Maybe students these days just have a bad attitude about learning anything."

"Same for length and weight, you don't say "" I'm 188 centimetres tall "", you just say "" I'm one eighty eight (1 - 88 )"", mostly you skip the metre because everyone would understand what you mean.
As you don't say "" I'm 85 kilograms "", you're just 85 kilo or 85 kilo's. 😉"
" @ytfan3815  That's interesting, I've heard that most of my international friends also say ""1.88"",  but at least in my family and with friends in sweden we'd say 188cm
But yeah, that's the beauty of it, everyone still understands because it's all technically the same"
" @witext  
Hi, btw I'm from the Netherlands and this is how we use it, I know lots of Germans and Belgiums do it the same way at least for lenght, we do international trade/business with them and I hear it quite often.
In our pasport or ID-card lenght is in metres like 1.88m, in medical files it is in centimetre, 188cm in  my case."
"4 19/32, but I am not anti-Metric.  Why does that interest you?"
"Hahahahaha, shit, your packaged food is weird! IN America nearly every packaged food I can think of has both units on it. Like, the peanut butter is 18 oz (1lb 2 oz) 510g.

It's like somebody said ""fuck it, put everything on the box!"" and I don't understand why they'd take it off the boxes for you guys :D"
"I have a new measuring tape with only feet, inches, and 16ths.  I have another with only cm and mm.  And another with both an engineer’s scale of feet, tenths, and hundredths and a conventional carpenter’s scale of feet, inches, and 16ths.  My old Stanley tape measure has only the common carpenter’s scale.  I probably bought it before the Metric Conversion Act led to promotion of the Metric System.

You can’t expect your neighborhood hardware store to carry every type of measuring tape, but you can find what you need online, if it exists.

I have a vintage Red End folding rule with only the carpenter’s scale, but the current one (now owned by Lufkin) also has only the inch-based carpenter’s scale.  I have two drafting rules from Germany in inches with two scales on each rule marked in full scale and 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 scale.

I’m thinking of getting a tape marked in inches and tenths.  I want to have all the options."
" @GH-oi2jf  I'm not doubting that you can get different kinds of measuring implements, but since he said ""Our measuring tapes,"" I presume he means the ones you buy in regular stores, so the standard.

And it strikes me as odd to have the standard leave out one of the two standard measures."
"Not true, because it isn’t about conversion.  There is very little conversion done in the everyday application of units."
"In America, millimeters are way more commonly understood than centimeters, but that's because common ammunition for firearms are denoted in either caliber (inch fractions) or millimeters."
"Having watched your video, I would agree with the M&Ms analogy. The UK has adopted the metric system far more fully than Canada. The only thing we use the imperial system for is vehicle speed, milk, beer (though bottled and canned beer has been primarily sold in metric for about 20 years now), body height and weight (Brits use stones and pounds, a stone being 14 pounds), and distances (inches, feet and miles are still used informally to approximate distances, though kilometres are used for walking/hiking due to their use in Ordinance Survey maps). Weights in recipes and food are almost universally metric nowadays, though some shops do quote weights in pounds as well. Farenheit is rarely seen. Something that is changing among younger Brits, however, is the use of kilograms to measure body weight. I, even as a relatively ancient 35 year old, after living in Malaysia for a while, have switched to using kilos to measure myself. It just feels much more intuitive than using stones and/or pounds. I do, however, stick to feet and inches for my height, I suspect because my height tends to change far less than my weight, so it's far easier to remember."
"Australia is full metric but we measure height in feet,  and also clothing often has inch measurements because of the countries we buy from.  I've worked with American companies,  so have had to convert units,  and I don't mind them,  but they are such a pain that I really don't understand why the average punter wants to go imperial.  But whatever,  you do you,"
"Brazil is (almost) fully metric... Two remarkable exceptions are the measures used in water pipes and car wheel rims, both traditionally measured in inches!"
"In Ireland, our metric journey is hampered by UK and U.S. influence, but we use metric officially for everything. Our UK neighbours not so much - as a result, Irish road signs change from metric to imperial as you cross the border into Northern Ireland (part of the UK). I can’t believe the UK still drags its feet on this."
"It is no brainer for the conversion inside each system, metric is far far superior. And to think that imperial nowadays actually just a mere conversion from metric lol"
In Sweden we still use inches for monitor sizes and tires.
"The USA's product labels are much the same: inches, pounds, etc. in a large font, with cm, grams, etc. in a small font. Contrary to our international reputation, we are gradually using metric units more, with liters and grams being the most familiar, as far as I've seen. For example, engine displacements and Coke bottles are sold in liters, and drugs typically list their contents in grams and their active ingredients in milligrams. So even the USA is a hybrid, even though we still fill our gas tanks by the (US customary) gallon, weigh ourselves in (US customary) pounds, measure our sports fields in feet or yards, etc."
🙌🙌 let's go metric!
"LOL, Canada uses metric currency (100 cents in the $) in photography (all film is in mm) in ammunition and guns (9mm etc) in standard drinks (cans of soft drinks, international bottles of alcohol)...but hey metric is hard"
"Waddaya mean the USofA doesn't love the metric system?  We buy hundreds of millions of 9x19mm, 7.62x51mm and 5.56x45mm cartridges every year!"
"Yes, most canadians dont realise how overly complicated their system is cuz they have never seen how much easier it can be with only 1"
"The way I see it, it doesn't matter in the end what you use, as they have their place in the world."
"WTF, Canada is a lie, and me thinking it was a metric nation. Here in Brazil, as far as I remember, the only things we use from the imperial system are tires (and wheels), TVs, plumbing and air conditioning, the first 3 are sold in inches and air conditioning uses ""BTU"" as a measure. Some woodworking and construction items are sold in inches too, but I don't know much about that area, but at the end of the day, everything is measured in metric, even those woodworking and construction items, because the tools are metric."
"I do think you make a good point with that language analogy, because in many ways the use of measurements is like a language unto itself. We use it so often to communicate with each other, and there are so many connotations and references and ideas made with them. And really, while people blame the U.S. for not getting behind metric, it's not as if we don't use it in the plaves where it matters. Metric within scientific circles is basically the lingua franca in much the same way English is in business and other areas, and while there are some hiccups, it's not as if we can expect cultures to suddenly change.

That's not to say that it's not worth moving to metric, of course, but it does feel like an aspect people miss. It's difficult to make those broad cultural/lingual changes in any immediate fashion, and it's not as if we don't use it already where it matters."

"The metric system is a system of measurement that uses the meter, liter, and gram as base units of length (distance), capacity (volume), and weight (mass) respectively. To measure smaller or larger quantities, we use units derived from the metric units."

"For me, since I do a lot of cooking and science I always think of small things as grams but when ever I think about my weight or the size of something really big, I will always use pounds.

Wow Canada is more like US than I thought. Seems that only cars and temperatures use metric. Even hearing you say height or paper size would be weird in metric is odd... I guess uniquely Canadian.
"I wonder what the situation is like in Quebec. Do they go along with the rest of the country or do their own thing, rejecting the terrible Anglo system for their pure French one?"
"The inches and centimetres on rulers at the same time are present in metric countries too, propably because of manufacturing and how making one thing for the whole world is just cheaper"
"Having been raised in France and lived most of my life in the US, I understand both system very well, but when in need of using ether one, I always turn to the metric, it's just so easy compare to the Imperial. I see the Imperial system now days, in use only by masochists."
"The USA has never used the Imperial System, which was introduced half a century after we left the Empire.  Also, we participated in le Convention du Mètre in 1875, the only English-speaking nation to do so."
"Even France, an 150% metric country, uses Nautical miles, Pound for some food, as well as Kg of course, and some other odd measurements. Old habits are hard to break."
"We Brits are the worst. Not because we use the Imperial system, but because we use both, so we’re forced to learn and use both rather than just using metric. The one good thing is that I can convert (roughly) imperial to metric and back pretty much on the fly.

some examples: We measure distances, and speeds on roads and hiking trails in miles, however our maps (OS maps) are metric
Again, our cars use Mph and gallons to measure fuel, but petrol and diesel are sold by the litre. 
Groceries are sold in metric generally (except milk, which is still in pints/gallons), and our recipes are in both metric and imperial depending on who published the recipes.

The general rule is that all our younger people use metric, all the old brexiteer boomers use imperial, and those in the middle use either or both."
"Metric system is best especially when you major in science, otherwise suffer with your retrded conversion system."

"I'm Canadian and I was taught and worked metric in college back in the mid 60s and when Canada began metrification I remember saying ""About time"" I even enjoyed watching the tortured faces of those who opposed the idea. I was also raised in a military family and was into nautical miles and even the 24 hour clock. I went on working in the tech world and land surveying and as the years went by I witnessed metric construction material such as plywood coming in at 1.2 by 2.4 meters (3 ft 11 in × 7 ft 10 in) and we all saw that disappear faster than it arrived. 
I still work with mm and cm and obviously I easily work with inches. I tend to be always converting to metric in many instances.
The problem is the idea of the need to convert from an old system to metric. That's where you lose peoples interest. Metric calculations can be done by a five year old, inches, yds. and miles on the other hand requires rulers and calculators. Converting is a hassle and the average joe would rather avoid it. OK, maybe that's just me but it's been barely two generations since and the average person still hangs on (and with good reason) to mother's recipes and grand mother's old recipes. Give it time, Canada will see the full metric world.
Always a great topic and JJ has an interesting way of presenting these topics."
"The cosmos its metric - if you use the imperial in astronomy you will be out of tune finding your self at the wrong time at the wrong place -  its nice to say that old constractions say piramids they all use the metric sistem say, Egipt, Peru, Mexico, Japan etc. the French were never the first to be METRIC."

Me and the Boi's ignoring the metric system
"I really don't get where you found that the metric system switched to mathematical formulas in 2018? It was already following mathematical principles since the start, and the weights and bars where used during the demonstration of the metric as a reference point to make it more understandable when first presented. Hance why they were kept as national treasures since those items where what convinced most of the world to adopt the system."
"Brit here , the UK is mostly metic all that matters , many people use Imperial only if it happens to be spot on."
"I actually would say that no country, but the USA, Canada and the UK have trouble excepting the imperial system. Of course Myanmar and Liberia still use officially the imperial system, but metric is used and will be implemented in both Countries.
I actually see no reason for anybody still using the imperial system."
"I think most of the former British colonies are like Canada. Like in India it is, in India we do use inches and feet etc for bodily measurements and it's impossible to hear metric units in real esate and many do actually measure their body temperature in fahrenheits (only body temperatures, I've never seen anyone use fahrenheits for weather) Other than those stuff, everything is indeed in metric. Literally no one uses gallons, pounds, ounces etc. Old people do mention miles but well tody speedometers are in kmph, odometers are in KM, distance in the sings are always in KM, speed limit in KM. By the way metrication happened in India between 1955-1962.
It is interesting how the countries which were once under the British Empire still uses some imperial units even after so many decades of metrication and even literally every rulers (we call them scales in India) has both cm and inches but in schools, cm is mostly preferred, I've never actually seen a cm only or inches only scales in India"
"My experience has been that the USA treats metric measurements as an appendage to the SAE system.  It's widely known that 1 mile is 1.6 km, 1 inch is 2.54 cm and a quart is 0.946 liters (33.8 oz).  For a society that used to non-decimal conversions, this isn't a heavy lift.  There's a certain pride that goes with having a uniquely American measurement system."
I live in Germany and our rulers also often have inches on them. So do our metersticks which we for some reason call Zollstock (which translates to Inch stick) nut not our measuring tapes. I guess this way its just easier for OEMs and makes their products eligible for all markets but measuring tapes are too narrow to fit both or something.
"as an american, a lot of products are also listed using both measurements and i was told it was easier to sell to both the us and canada if they had just one set of labels to print instead of “this chunk of products using imperial getting sold to the us” and “this chunk using metric to canada”"
"Fahrenheit notes- Water freezes @ 32*F becoming a solid. Water boils @ 212*F becoming a gas.. 212* - 32* = 180*. Water goes through the 3 stages of matter (before plasma was discovered) in 180*F, the element does a completer turn around through the stages of matter in 180*. That makes sense. Fahrenheit did it on purpose. Why did Fahrenheit make 32* the freezing point & not 0*?  Zero would make more sense as a starting point wouldn't it? What if Fahrenheit was a 32* Master Mason, would it make sense then? Fahrenheit also set the average human body temperature @ 98.6*F. .98.6* - 32*= 66.6*. Fahrenheit set the average human body temperature 66.6* hotter than the freezing point of water. Is that a coincidence?"
We (in the USA) already use Metric units wherever necessary.

"I'm a British Columbian who's worked in manufacturing/construction for 16 years and I've had to work in both metric and imperial, but I can only recall one job where the parts were actually designed in metric.

A job that's designed in imperial would require a 13/64 hole 1"" from the end of a part.

A job that's designed in imperial but trying to be metric (usually for gov't purposes) would want a 5.1mm hole 25.4mm from the end a part.

But a job that is truly designed in metric would have a 5mm hole 25mm from the end of a part.

And as someone who does a lot a baking, I'd say the worst unit of measurement is Americans who measure butter in sticks."
"There's an interesting discussion to be had here about how the alleged superiority/rationality of the 19th century European metric system interfaces with colonization and eurocentrism. The top-down establishment of measurement systems is inherently about authority and political power disparity. I find that America didn't ""Fail"" to adopt the metric system so much as it refused to accept a perceived European power play, and America wields sufficient economic and cultural power to do so, where other countries were effectively forced to abandon their native measurement systems in order to function in a global marketplace."

"Hey, you know what, it does not matter if you use cm or mm cuz you just have to move the point to the left or right. And yep i am pro metric =))))"
"Surely someone mentioned it. But I wish you mentioned that the reason people think metric is more intuitive is not merely because it is defined arround ""better"" objects. But just because it converts and operates easily arround each other. Centimeters to meters and kilometers, cubic meters to liters and so on. If people use meters to measure their height and kilometers to measure distance, they are not actually using two different units, just literally stating the distances in terms of thousends of meters, or grams and kilograms. As opposed to inches, feet and miles, or ounces and pounts, which are not actually related to each other, they are completely different units with some conversion rule that must be done to go between them.
That is what is easy and convenient about the metric system, just overall less memorization and less thinking about converions."
"I think using millimeters over centimeters is mostly a Japanism. Here in Germany centimeters are used for short everyday measurements, only engineers really use millimeters.

Presumably because using 1,000 as conversion factor everywhere is most useful (that would also explain why they use permill over percent, e.g. in rail line grade, as that is just rise in millimeters over run in meters, or alternatively rise meters over run kilometers). 🙂"

"“Sticks” are convenient, because butter for home use is most commonly sold in one pound packages divided into four sticks.  A recipe is more likely to specify tablespoons for butter, unless a recipe calls for one whole stick.  It is easy to measure butter in tablespoons because a stick is wrapped in paper marked in tablespoons (eight per stick).  If you live somewhere that does not have butter packaged in sticks, then of course it would seem not to make sense, but when it is packaged that way, it is easy.

Of course a lot of baking requires greater precision.  People who are into that kind of baking will measure ingredients by weight, even in the USA."

"measurements are all equal once  the conversions between larger and smaller units are understood , as long  as the units are consistent. a rocket built with metric is the same as a rocket built with imperial as long as the scale of the units is stable. you could use defunct russian argennes to measure shit for all it matters. Chemistry itself has it's own more convenient measurement units called moles that are incredibly hard to convert to either metric or imperial  but work perfectly for chemical equations. BTW imperial is roman in origin and was used to literally build western civilization. if you compare the efficacy of either unit system based on the real world success of past achievements, then imperial outstrips metric by a huge margin as roman roads and aqueducts are still used to this day centuries later."

On the other hand, the bench jewelers and a few former apprentices (including myself) were trained using SI. There are a lot of blank stares when we all talk to each other. In my opinion, anything less than an inch should be measured in millimeters."
"I never realized that Canadians used the Imperial system that much, I always thought you guys used the metric system as well.

I honestly thought that many products sold in the US were marked in both imperial and metric to sell to Canadians (like they're marked in French to sell in Québec), but I guess it's just to please the Government of Canada instead.

We're all taught in the US the metric units before the imperial ones, so we know roughly what each one looks like. There have been a lot of attempts to metricate the country, all of which failed miserably. Perhaps instead, we could also adopt a hybrid system?"
Kinda Similiar in India except the wieght part
Metric is superior. The imperial system crashes $200 million orbiters into the surface of Mars.
"As the joke goes in America, the only Americans who are well versed in the metric system are probably drug dealers."
"Metric isn't only useful because it's more logical, with everything divisible by 10, it's also more useful because it's a universal system, back when metric didn't exist, each country had its own system and everyone had to convert."
Not really that far from India.
From my experience we use centimetres way more often than inches in canada but I digress
"The problem is not getting used to miles, it's when you have to use units or subunits of them ( yards, inches, feet, whatever!!!)."
JJ I think I’m in love with you…
"Watching such videos, it's very easy to start hating most people"
"I am Bhaarateeya(Indian). People still use acres for farmland; feet for height, square feet plot of land; inches for pipes and fittings; but have shifted to gram and litre for weight and volume respectively. State also has official calender but nobody expect state uses that."
"No report on Metric is complete without discussing the places where Metric has FAILED dismally:

Metric Time, most notably.

But notice also that no one makes a 'Metric Compass'.  Division of a circle into North-South-East-West will never work in metric.  So notice too that NO ONE divides the globe's latitude & longitude in metric. 

And there will NEVER be 'Metric Music', where measures are divided into 10 beats, and octaves are divided into 10 semitones.  Because it sounds absolutely horrid.

Division by 12 will always be the standard for music.  Because it is harmonious.  And calendars will continue to have 12 months.  The Moon naturally divides the year this way.

When metric was invented, the French understood the harmonious advantages of Base 12, and considered switching the entire number system over to that before revamping the measuring system.  But that proposal failed.

And this is why metric will always fail.  Because it lacks natural harmony.  It lacks this fundamental property of divisibility that Base 12 has.  Metric always FAILS when you attempt to do something as simple as divide by 3, or divide by 4.

Do you know the reason why Base 10 is so popular?  Because it is how many fingers we have.  So metric will always have this Achilles Heel of being rooted in this non-harmonious, juvenile basis of finger counting."
"04:16 Nice gross (sic) oversimplification there. The US was totally not at that meeting in 1824, like Canada totally was. The British did not try to ""sneak in"" anything, it was just that gallons and bushels varied by county in the UK and the US had an arbitrary one, also based on those medieval standards that they decided to take up at a national level. Liquid and Dry weights, especially the Stone, which I still use to measure my own dry weight as well as know it in Metric is also not used by the Yanks. Do you like dividing their stupid pound weights for boxers by 13 to get it in Stone? No? Because most people don't bother and just get annoyed at the Yanks for having a system that literally no one else uses, apart from some Islands in the Pacific and the Japanese for a while because they were nuked into using US ""Imperial"", which is an oxymoron.

British imperial was based on the inherited Roman system of weights, like with the old money being based on what copper was worth relative to Silver and then Gold for coin ratios, not a decimal system like the Americans had. That's why livestock were measured in hands or the inch was based on the thumb, because these were ancient measurements like the Egyptians used. This is basic stuff.

You also missed out on long and short tons, or the fact that they do Knots wrong as well.

I understand that you're going to try to do some sort of dumbed-down, oversimplified ""both sides"" about imperial, but it doesn't work, because like with the English, one is Imperial and the other isn't. Theirs isn't, it's a bad copy, worse than even the Chinese would do.

For most of Canada's history, as well as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India of course, they all used normal imperial and spoke normal English, just like in England, it was and is only the US that doesn't. Canada in particular has had some bad osmosis from the US with both, but that's not globally, is it? I understand that you will try to use people's overall ignorance to sell them a dumbed down pup to get your narrative across, but basically, sometimes people have to choose. I've used both all my life and Metric wins hands down, both at work when making things or in a lab, or to get into space, even, when designing things, and when living in other countries, metric wins and when it's not metric, actual imperial always beats Mickey Mouse US ""imperial"" because again, more people down here on planet Earth use it, including the Canadians when they built all those tanks and ships that kept us in the war with their bomber-proof factories.

Proper tanks and ships made with proper measurements and not the dumb ones they used over the lakes, NAFTA notwithstanding."
Fyi: American rulers almost always have centimeters too.
"Not a good joke, though, because everyone trained in the sciences is familiar with Metric units.  Everyone in a medical field uses Metric units.  Most mechanics use mostly Metric wrenches, nowadays.  We all buy wine and spirits in Metric bottles (except the teetotalers)."
"The only subunits of miles we (in the USA) use in conjunction with miles are fractions.  For example, we might say something is a mile and a half away.  On the highway, the distance to the next city is given in miles, but the distance to the next exit might be 1/2 mile or 1/4 mile.  Passing lanes will be announced one mile in advance.

A horse race length might be given in furlongs, but it could be “a mile and a quarter.”

When we use feet, we generally stay with feet.  Surveyors mostly use feet, tenths, and hundredths.  Machinists working on a smaller scale use inches and thousandths.  We don’t use yards much at all — mainly on a football field.  A ten yard advance gets a “first down,” but if it is a little short you might say “about a foot” or “inches.”  That isn’t complicated.  Everybody knows what a foot and inch are."
Hate hurts the hater.
"The US gallon is not arbitrary.  It was the British “wine gallon.”  At one time there were different gallons for different substances in Britain.  The American colonies chose one which became the US gallon, then the British chose another to be used everywhere in the Empire and discarded the others."
As a Brit i’ed say the m&m analogy is about right. The younger the generation the more metric. The only time I use imperial is for body weight and height (although that’s just because others insist) and when ordering a drink (I think it will always be called a pint of…. Even if they changed the size).
"uk use metric
i know because i live in the uk"
"I could go on for hours about this topic.  I thought the Brits use ""Stone"" for bodily weight.. literally from the stone age!  Perhaps they kept it to avoid confusion about their ""Pounds"" money.  As  Canadians,  we have the British Imperial unit heritage plus US units and metric all rolled into a mess.  For some reason, Americans use 2 liter (litre) plastic bottles for soda. Actually COVID distancing is 2 metres which is 6.57 feet, not 6 feet."
"Australia went full metric. Just rip the bandage off. I was young when it happened so some things still linger like inches and feet. When I work it's all metric though. So much simpler.



What annoys me is the social reference to imperial for baby weight. Use metric. I'm used to weight being metric now.

Still not sure how tall I am though."
"one area where we (in the us) use a mix of metric and imperial is when we measure the weight of drugs. when i was in middle/high school we’d almost always talk about weed in terms of grams but now that weeds legal in my state its usually labeled in terms of ounces and people are more likely to buy it in larger quantities rather than by the gram so its not necessary to think of it in terms of smaller units, instead you would think about it as a fraction of a standard ounce, this isn’t something ive noticed with other drugs either because they’re still illegal or because the safest dosages are better suited to be measured in grams/mg/µg"
"As a person in the Uk, apart from height and roads...never used imperial.
One thing to note is that, at least for me, there used to be a thing where people mesaured their own weight in pound and stones, but..Ive never done that myself and haven't seen anyone do that in years."
"Blame it on Nixon it was his idea to go metric:)

Everyone born after 1970 was educated in metric. In reality we work both. I am more comfortable in metric… And I don’t stress it"
"America is unique, with the character quality of not giving into peer pressure. Which goes hand in hand with who we are. And ironically, Europe imposing its ways onto others is precisely why we broke off to begin with. Not saying it’s always a bad thing, especially if what they want for others could just magically happen. But do you want another reason? 

We could have established ourselves with Metric during our nations infancy, but English pirates robbed us of ever having that opportunity by killing a French man who was on his way to meet Thomas Jefferson with a kilogram weight, in an attempt to convince and educate the American people about metric. The pirates delivered the kilogram to a different Secretary of State and the Americans said: 

“What the hell is this?” 

So in a way - Britain is how we got the imperial system, but also how we were denied from having Metric which kinda damned it from ever fully happening. But then again, we wanted to keep trading with Britain who was previously the most powerful nation that’s also a parent country. And thus not establishing our expanse country with Metric. So Europe takes credit in that. One of many examples how decisions can impact the future, even centuries later. Industries and NASA will use Metric, but it’d be a logistical nightmare to fully convert and then finally educate three hundred million people about metric. No one wants to undergo the task of replacing everything across America and educating so many, besides the outrageous bill that would come from it while we’re already on the verge of recession."
"India does the very same. Govt Covid mandates said ""stay 6ft apart"" nd we always talk of height in ft like ""Oh I'm 5'5"" But for distances it's always KMS ""20kms for bengaluru"" etc very odd and a remnant of Britan for sure."
"You honestly think construction is done in imperial because marketing is imperial?  Which one do you think is properly hard to change?  Which one requires costly government intervention to even be feasible?

Sure people don't personally adapt well to changes in measurement system, but when the plumbing code says your horizontal pipe runs must drop 1/4"" per foot, and 85% of Canada's plumbing code is just borrowed from the U.S. federal standard...and your pipe is mass-produced by a U.S. supplier with inner diameter in inches, by imperial-centric manufacturing equipment...and the entire structure of all existing housing and standard architecturally-sound approaches is scaled by 4'x8' subdivisions and similar...need I continue?

As hard as it is to change people's minds, that's actually the easiest hurdle by far."
"It was very funny to mw watch you trying to enact how we would say stuff. 
- We don't actually say the size of the sheet, they are named. Like, the common sheet of paper (210x297) is A4 and so on. I'm pretty everybody uses it.
- Height: we say: ""I'm one seventy five"". We all understand it's one meter and seventy five centimeters. Unless you're an orc. Then you are required to be more specific.
- On the rulers topic, yeah, they come in mm, but there are marks of cm as well. As we want to be precise, mm is very important in this context. 

What throws me off the most about the Imperial system is that there are so many different weights and measurements. Yards, ounces, pounds, feet, inches, and whatnot.

Interesting enough, we will use inches (only, I am almost sure) when talking about the screen sizes of devices. I don't know why."
"Definitely think America should go metric. Once learned it'll make more sense. Like celcius is basically the freezing and boiling point of water. So 0°C is 32°F and 100°C is 212°F, which is the boiling point of water"
Celsius sucks. The rest is fine.
"We use mm for pipe inner diameter and outer diameter, but also the length which doesn’t make much sense because it’s hard to picture what thousands of mm looks like lol"
"I live here in Louisiana, I worked at a locally owned steel company for about 5 years using standard, I went to a German steel company afterwords also here in town and had to learn metric, honestly very confusing to conceptualize at first. I believe conceptualizing is the hardest part, not the way the math works. Now we’re getting bought out by an Argentinian company so I have no idea whether we’re going back to standard or staying metric, they already have several American divisions and I’m unaware what they use. Anyway both systems are fine, metric feels a bit more accurate but whether it’s one 64th or 1-1000th doesn’t make a shit to me as long as it’s right."
Interesting fact: The USA officially adopted the Metric system in 1986. The problem was pretty much everyone ignored it. However the US military uses the metric system and so do many large US companies and all US scientists.
Seeing 2 years ago as a date on a video about covid feels so weird. Time has flown.
"hmmm in QC I guess we're more metric then the rest of Canada, French influence?"
"the only product that unifies the metric and imperial system is drugs, you can get grams, ounces, pounds, and even kilos"
"Being in the US, I have always felt stunted because I cannot figure out a way to intuitively understand metric measurements. If I worked in the STEM fields, maybe I would have more of an opportunity to truly ‘know’ the metric system."
"yeah the pint is one of those things that they fought to keep because of its deep cultural history
British pubs have sold pints of beer for centuries, and they weren't about to change
the fact that the term 'a pint' almost universally refers to beer says it all"
"this seems to be regional. Where I'm from everyone weighs themselves in stone and pounds, even children (unless forced to use kg by doctors or whoever)
I've seen it on TV too
but i know other brits online who laugh at the idea"
Any American born earlier who studied sciences used Metric.  The United States adopted the Metric System in 1866.
"The multiple names for units in US Customary (and Imperial) units is easy because we tend to use only one unit in a particular context, sometimes two.  For example, we use miles for distance between cities and feet  for things which are at a human scale, such as the size of a room.  Feet and inches together are for a person’s height, one of the few places where we commonly use two units.  When you use one unit for a broad scale of sizes (“meter”) you require prefixes to get scale (millimeter and kilometer), which add syllables so make the system more cumbersome linguistically.  In common language (as opposed to scientific) we like economy of expression, so, for example, although the US Army uses kilometers, they call a kilometer a “click.”"
"​ @GH-oi2jf  well, it may be intuitive for someone growing up with them, but not for foreigners. 
I don't think there's a better system. My point was only what throws me off, I didn't want to imply it was hard altogether."
" @IvanChagasVosuni  — understood.  I’m just explaining why it isn’t difficult to those who use it.  Consider that language, generally, contains a lot of words, often multiple words with similar but slightly different meanings.  Most people develop a large vocabulary in their native language.  Names of units are just a few more words."
"The United States adopted the Metric System in 1866.  We use it in many ways, just not exclusively."
" @GH-oi2jf  You all should use metric not only in science labs. 

Metric System is designed to be easy and absolute."
Accuracy does not depend on units.
We actually adopted the Metric System in 1866.  The Metric Conversion Act was 1975.  It is not a problem that most people ignored it.  We have never mandated general conversion from legacy units.
"I have used both US and metric from childhood. 
   There are problems with metric threads, since most countries have their own metric threads. So when machining metric threads, which country's standard threads is critical."

My Canadian friend would often measure her height in centimeters rather than feet and inches is that not a common Canadian thing ?
I am a patriotic American and defend a lot of customs we have that others think are odd. But I wish America would go metric

We use both grams and ounces on food"
"I'm an engineer for a US military contractor; we use thousandths of an in (known as a mil, thou, or E-3) for our RF devices, we will switch to mm on those same devices for soldering macro components, those macro components are measured in inches, our environmental and sealing departments use in/ib for torque, PSI for air pressure but use Pka for pressure of a sealed device and Celsius for temperature (except for the weather which we use Fahrenheit). for wires we use mils for gold wire, thous for machined copper wire, and AWG (American wire gauge) for copper wires and if for any reason we use special wire from another country we instead measure it in millimeters. We have a handbook that goes over all of the units of measurement we use and its about 8 pages long. Funny part is, it's not that confusing, it took some time getting use to it when I started but after a year or two in the field it just kinda made sense and I kinda wouldn't want it to change at this point as I have an understanding of each size based upon what I'm using it for. they're all just made up units anyways"
"At about 8:00 it is incorrectly stated that the British and the US “ditched their object-based standards” for Metric definitions in 1959.  In fact, the United States defined US Customary units in terms of Metric units in 1893.  In 1959, the United States and Britain agreed to replace their differing definitions of linear measure by adopting the machinist’s inch of 2.54 cm as the International Inch.  There were some other changes made at the same time."
"UK, specifically England, here - it's extremely unlikely that we will ever go fully metric, unfortunately. We made it pretty far but, post-Brexit, there seems to be a push to ""reclaim our national identity"", and the Tories have made reference to wanting to revive imperial units. Frankly it's a joke, as is much of our politics, and a huge waste of money at that."
"It's limitedly has interchangeability in Australia

Land measured in hectares and acers is also measured in m3, never sqft though. We have Metric and Imperial on all our food, and generally use both interchangeably for height, shoe size or even... penis, but not weight, probably a lot of other examples I'm not thinking of.

Best example is actually in our speech, we use a lot of imperial units to speak to each other when expressing something, even though we may not know what that is in metric, and it's generally what we're most familiar with, but that could be a symptom of american media 

Aussie's are weird, unsurprisingly lol"
"I love how when you say ""European empires..."" the entire world gets highlighted"
"In GB we use a unit called a stone, equal to 14lb for body weight. I understand this unit  isn't used in the US.
Also GB was one of the last countries to adopt decimal currency. Before 1971 the pound  [£] was worth 20 shillings and the shilling was worth 12 pence [confusingly, the abbreviation for the old penny was d], before 1961 the penny was further subdivided into four farthings. I  can just  remember the old system, I was12 when the change was made.  The coins in regular use were 1/2d, 1d, 3d, 6d, 1s, 2s, 2s6d and the notes were 10s, £1, £5 and £10. The 3d piece was nicknamed a' joey'; a 6d was a 'tanner'; a shilling was a 'bob' a 2s piece was a 'florin' and the 2s6d coin was called a half-crown [there was also a 5s coin called a crown but these were never in general circulation, they were just  issued as commemoratives from time to time].The pound was nicknamed a 'quid', this slang term is still used."
"When I was looking for housing in Korea, I noticed on the listings, floorspace was displayed using 평 (pyeong) and square meters. 평, according to Wikipedia, is roughly 3.03 square meters/35.583 sq ft."
Okay baking is the one thing that you should always f**** use grams is just easier just plop it on a scale you have the exact right amount doesn't matter whether you pack it or fluff it up or sift it or whatever it's always the same at least f**** use pounds for everything or ounces or whatever
People measure their height in centimeters like 154 cm you really don't know this LMAO
"I've noticed a bit of a generational divide (in the UK) about which systems we use
My parents, born in the early 60s making them boomers, use the imperial system, and still to this day get confused my metres and kilograms.
Meanwhile, me and my siblings don't really understand imperial as well as metric, although we still measure ourselves in feet and inches"
"While Japan is firmly metric for pretty much everything, there are a few random things here that tend to be measured in inches specifically due to what I assume is American influence. For example, wheels on a car and TVs/computer monitors are almost exclusively measured in inches. Like you mentioned, there are also still quite a few random things that still use traditional systems of measurement. For example, the size of rooms is almost always measured in tatami mats even in western style rooms. The total floor area of a house or apartment on the other hand favors using square meters from my experience, but the traditional measurement is also sometimes still used."
"14:38 - Interesting observation, and I have a little American anecdote similar to this. Almost exclusively in the nutrition facts label, the metric system is used to define a serving. Usually for food it revolves around 1 oz (servings are usually 27-31g, an oz is ~28.34g) and for beverages it revolves around 8 floz. (~237ml)
I have two theories for why this is, and both could be partially true. Either it's to conform with Canadian law, or it's to not over-inform the lazy consumer, as you suggest."
We are bimetral.  We adopted the Metric System in 1866.  We use it in many ways.  You are free to use it.
" @GH-oi2jf  i do use it. Maybe not daily, but often. And always when I'm speaking to non-americans. 
Only problem is that it's kind of a douche move to use it when others don't understand it"
"Why not just learn the units?  When I visit Europe I am not bothered by Metric units, even though I rarely use them.  A temperature of 20°C is 68°F.  A km is a little less than 2/3 mile.  A kg is 2.2 lbs.  It isn’t rocket science."
I'm from England and I like that we are both metric and imperial.
" @anglosaxon4571  Likewise, I think most things are fine as they are, but the Conservative party in particular are making Imperial and the return of Imperial a big part of their platform for some reason."
" @scarlettscented  I think it would be wrong to make others have have a system they don't feel right with, they should be free to choose what system they want to use."
" @anglosaxon4571  I agree to an extent, although this is not at all what the Tories are arguing - from the polls they have put out, it is quite clear that they intend to transition entirely to Imperial, which benefits nobody."
"​ @anglosaxon4571  Idk, i think that in many cases the people don't really know what's best in the long term. To me it seems like in cases where somewhere has a measuring system that's not used in the rest of the world many pervasive & minor inconveniences crop up, changing to the system that everyone else uses presents one relatively large inconvenience at the start but stops those minor inconveniences from cropping up again & to me it seems like in the long term this would prevent more irritancy than it would incur."
We still use “d” for penny in the US for nails.  A “tenpenny” nail is 10d.
"Eh. At the end of the day, most cooking isn't precise enough that variations in the weight of a given volume actually matter."
We measure screens in inches too here in Italy
"Same for TVs/monitors in Russia. The package mentions both like xx"" (xxx cm) but younger generations use sizes in inches. And since one has to use Pythagoras theorem for determining the actual size anyway, multiplying by 2.54 is not the hardest part of this calculation."
"Screens, pants, font size are exceptions in Poland. And I especially hate screen one. If screen have  65"" diagonal it says absolutely nothing about it's size.  It can be 25x60 or 39x52 and still have same diagonal"
"Neither, it’s just because nutrition is science and the people who work out those tables prefer to use Metric units.  The United States is bimetral, so there is nothing unusual about it.

Another reason is that it would take too much room to give dual units.  Usually, the package size is given in dual units, but that is just one number."
" @GH-oi2jf  The space issue may have been an issue before maybe 2005, but now these labels use dynamic width. This canister of Lay's Stax, for example, clearly has narrower text on the second line of nutrition facts.

So I've hunted down the original law (21 cfr 101.9) and it looks like the law requires some real world measurement but doesn't require use of imperial. This usually translates to N chips, N crackers, but sometimes tbsp/cups which is pretty meaningless for processed snack foods. On top of this ""practical"" quantity, a metric quantity is explicitly required by law.

Pretty neat."
"This is one of the most comprehensive videos on this subject. Coming from Australia though, you really should have added the rest of the Commonwealth to your examples, as we all had similar experiences.

Metric and the US love/hate of it is very interesting. But the story could have been so different.
July 4th 1773 is of course a pivotal date. Casting out the British Empire, it would be a couple of decades before everything would be in place enough to call themselves truely independent.

There were three major things keeping the US connected to the British Empire.

1. Language: There were many languages present, with the most common at the time being German. However after much persistence and having political friends, Noah Webster had intentions to not only drive English as the primary language, but to forge new variations compared with the empire that would sell them on it as being apart from the British.

2. Currency: Pounds, Shillings, Pence. How annoying confusing and British. One pound was equal to 20 shillings, one shilling was equal to 12 pence.
In 1784 Thomas Jefferson presented his ""Notes on Coinage"" to Congress. Decimalisation made sense and was adopted.

For clarify - $1 = 100 cents. Very straightforward.

3. Measurement: Unfortunately at the time there wasn't a sensible replacement to imperial.

Thankfully in this period, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were ambassadors to France. In around 1789, they were speaking to the French about this and really impressed on them the benefits of decimalisation. They too were looking for a new measurement system to consolidate the many systems in France alone, which really impacted trade.
Prieur du Vernois presented a suggestion to the National Academy of France for a single uniform set of weights and measures (almost identical to what he may have heard from Jefferson).
Bottom line, the essential ingredient was making it base 10 and using prefixes like mili.

In this regard, early US settlement likely had a major impact on making the metric system as successful as it is today (even if purely by speculation). But sadly Congress would happily adopt decimalisation of currency, but not measurement.

---

With regards to metric behind the scenes, you're right in the the official date of the international foot and pound was in 1959.
But there was so much inconsistency between imperial standards that it was actually in 1930 (Britain) and 1933 (US), that the first sign of the new industrial inch (conversion from metric standards rather than imperial ones), was seen.


--- 

Compared to the US, Australia dragged its feet much more. Although the US was quick to embrace metric beneath the surface, Australia WAS NOT.

But our move to metric was far more swift and prescribed when it occurred.
People still talk about imperial when mentioning height, but everything else is metric.

One really successful metric adoption was the building industry.

And the key here was - metres and millimetres only! No centimetres.
All measurements on a building site are in mm to ensure that there are no decimal places.

And in the early days, Australia's largest home builder (AV Jennings), built two identical homes as a test.
One had plans in metric, and one in imperial.

Benefits started to show immediately on the metric site. Fraction additions were out the window. No more fractional rulers. Not fractions at all. Measurements were considered more accurate by feel in metric; a comment many builders in the US make when they try metric.

In the end.

1. The imperial site had several truck worths of waste - the metric site had a single wheelbarrow
2. The imperial site cost 10% more to build

After that test, imperial was banished from anything related to buildings. Including today with real estate."
I prefer cooking/baking in metric. I even measure liquids in grams even though the density of liquids can vary most of the time it's close enough to water's 1g = 1ml
Australia is almost totally metric
"In Britain (and in my experience), metric is almost exclusively used for science, maths and weighing things, whereas imperial is used for estimates, particularly of length and distance. However kilometres and miles are used fairly equally, and I still meet people who measure their own weight in ""stone*."
"I'm from El Salvador. Our official measurements system is Metric but we buy gasoline using gallons, weight is measured in pounds and things like nails and screws are sold in inches."
In America I think it’s more common to find a ruler and or product size description with both standard and metric.
"Whenever people get worked up about our not switching to metric, I say wake me up when you switch to metric time. If switching to base 10 was totally worthwhile, we would have metric time as well."
"If that 1215 sq ft floor area were square, how would you go about calculating the wall lengths in feet and inches?
Please show me your written calculation... anybody?"
Golly gosh young man.  You really do need to do more research before publishing videos.  A little understanding of physics and arithmetic might help you.
"In Australia and NZ we still talk about human height in terms of feet. We say someone is 6 feet tall, not however many cm talk, otherwise no one would know what they were talking about."
When I buy a satnav the FIRST thing I do is go into settings and set distances to miles and yds.
It’s so funny every time FJ makes a vocal cameo🤣
I was told as a kid in the early 80s that we were going metric which kind of went away by the time I was in high school
The UK will eventually turn Metric. It's a pretty slow process to be honest.
"The UK is the same, we supposedly adopted the Metric System, but rely on Imperial measurements in everyday life. Roadsigns give distances in miles, and people give their height in feet and inches and their weight in stones and pounds."
"Metrication did have a big impact on Britain, the currency."
So I (as an America) was getting bashed for being non-metric because everyone else in the world but three places does metric now.  It is refreshing to hear that we are not that far off and that the internet may in fact be fallible.
"I live in the US and I make airplanes for a living and all the engineering drawings are in inches and thousandths of an inch (or finer, depending on situation.)"
"What an inch is divided into? 
Cm is divided into mm and allows quite precise measurement, since cm is a bit less than half of an inch and mm is one tenth of cm."
"Funny thing about construction in canada. Like you said, we generally use imperial for most things, but all rules and building codes are exclusively metric. This creates a bit of a headache, not awful just a thing we deal with."
"That’s because conversion is coerced.  I’ve read that measuring tools with English units are actually illegal in Australia, at least to sell.  Can Australians buy them online if they need them or will postal inspectors intercept them?"
"The square root of 1215 would be the length of one side.  Most people would use a calculator to compute a square root, whether they preferred US or Metric units.

I would estimate it by noting that 2^10 is 1024, so the root is just a little larger than 2^5, or 32.  I can square 34 in my head and get 1156, and that’s close enough for me if I don’t have a calculator.  There is no written calculating so far.  If I had to have a more precise figure, and couldn’t use a calculator, I would look for my slide rule or my table of logarithms.

Trying 34.5, I use paper to write down the sum 900 + 120 + 15 + 138 + 17.25 = 1190.25.  That’s pretty close, so it’s a little more than 34’6”.  It might be closer to 34’9”, based on the increase made by adding half a foot.  I don’t need it any more accurately than that.  By the way, surveyors in the US would use tenths and hundredths of a foot for a precise length, not inches, so 34.75 feet.

I’m sure people who use the Metric system also prefer calculators to take square roots."
Precision does not depend on units.  An inch is divided any way you choose to do it.  Machinists divide the inch decimally into thousandths or ten-thousandths.  A mm is about .04 inch.  Precision machining can be done in millionths (microinches).
I live in the stats and most thermometers I see are in both Fahrenheit and Celsius
"The fact is that UK is mostly metric in general aspects such as small or more precise measurements for CMs and these are the ones taught in schools, however most people do have cars with miles per hour and so are sign posts and height is still done in feet and inches (at least with friends and family) and most cooking and baby food measurements is purely ounces and pounds so is weight done in stone and pound. So it’s quite bisystemic"
As an engineering student in Mexico my frustrations with the imperial system is that there's no easy way to remember the conversations and because it is still used in the US we are forced to learn their standards
"In metric countries, we do give measurements of products and such in mm, but I think most people (as myself) think in cm."
Why was Portugal excluded from that initial map lmao I'm 100% sure Portugal already existed smh
I am a proud enemy of the metric system.
A lot of the rulers in the USA have cm on them too just sayin g
"Here in Spain, al least in Andalucía, the only non-metric unit I've ever used is the ""fanega"". Which is an extremely decentralized unit used to mesure area of farmland. It's quite ridiculous, fanegas are different sizes in every village or town."
I’m a Brit and am perfectly happy using both 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Even in Australia with complete metrication 
We’ll stay say “That’s Miles away” I guess it’s just a shorter word than Kilometres"
"In the US, food packages list both imperial and metric. I ignored the metric."
One of the few things I dislike about being American is having US Letter size as the general rather than A4
I always found it weird that in Germany (a whole metricated country) things like screen and display sizes of computers or smartphones or DIY supply (as pipes or screws) is very often measured in inches...why for christs sake?
"It's a compromise, most people use a combination (even in countries that have formally adopted the metric system) mostly because it takes less syllables to say ""six foot two than"" it does to say ""one hundred and eighty eight point nine hundred and seventy six centimetres"""
"The really bizarre thing is our measurement units for cups. Because ours are done in metric volumes, so for, example there's a tablespoon extra flour in our cup to an American one. Which is also a weird statement considering weight is usually used for metric recipes for dry goods."
"I assumed that new generations had moved further towards metric. I'm JJ's age and have no concept of miles, gallons, ounces, Fahrenheit; though my parents do since they were alive in the 70s. I intentionally use metric as much as possible, even in situations where it's not as popular to do my part in a cultural phase-out. This might be related to Canada's anti-American cultural identity JJ often talks about. I do use feet/inches for height and pounds for weight, but anything to do with healthcare is only metric."
In America we are taught the metric system but we all tend to forget it because we dont really need to remember it unless we go abroad.
"Most of measurement in life results in estimation values -- 'ball-park' numbers. 1 ounce is about one big gulp of beer. My foot in about . . . 1 ft. My thumb is almost exactly 1 inch wide. 
As I see it the biggest difference is in how many syllables you need to use to express yourself. In conversation the metrically inclined seem to refer to millimeters or kilometers when not talking about body-size.
The Celsius scale is all about marketing. Kelvin is the real scale. However, for human values of comfort 1deg. K or C is too big. Make your house one degree C hotter or cooler and its a big step.
If I need to specify some decimal interval then I need even more syllables.
There is nothing about the fluid volume Liter to recommend it.
In technical fields, SI / Metric use is fine and even makes sense sometimes.
I can use both with nearly equal facility. I just don't like SI or Metric units intuitively or conversationally.


Most of my interests involve the Planck scale or multiples of LightYears -- miles and kilometers are essentially irrelevant..."
You forgot Myanmar. Everyone forgets Myanmar.
"@11:40

Ontarian architectural technologist co-op student here. Tbh I have no idea what other places do or how things were maybe a decade ago, but currently the Ontarian architecture and construction industries (along with most, if not all of the sister industries like electric, plumbing, etc) use metric. The OBC is mainly in metric (other than things like unit/conversion charts), and when doing things like working drawings (floor plans, elevations, etc..), everything is measured in mm.

The only time I think I used imperial was in the first term of my program when learning things like how to use a scale, bim, and cadd.

Love your videos though, including this one!"
"That’s because 1-foot rulers are mostly for school use.  Professionals can buy whatever they prefer.  I have two inch-based rules for drafting, and tapes with various scales, including one Metric-only tape."
You are free to use DIN sizes if you prefer.
Or unless you are in medicine or work on cars.
"I WILL say this though. It's ironic because objects like bricks, lumber sizes, etc are still named things like ""two by four"" even though they're dimensioned in metric 🙃"
"The Philippines is mostly Metric with some lingering native and american-era remnants. Kinda like an inverse Canada, especially with food measurements where metric is in bold with imperial units besides it. 

Construction is where you'll encounter imperial units, pipes diameters are inches (but lengths are in meters), Plywood and most paneling are 4'x 8' but are rounded off to 1.2 x 2.4m in most applications, small paint amounts are in CC, but bigger ones switch to gallons.

Paper is a weird mish-mash having 3 standard sizes, the letter (colloquially called short) 8.5x11"", legal (called long) 8.5x13"" and the metric A4. Which is really annoying for they all have important uses and confusion between a4 and short is very rampant especially in schools. (nothing annoys me more in accidentally printing in a4 where the req. is in short)"
"I always use ""Metric"", why?  Because it pissed me off in Primary school that we had to use ""Metric"" but never actually used ""Metric"".  I remember a question in grade 8 math class that used Feet, instead of Meters.  I converted the question to Meters and the teacher got mad, and refused to give me credit.

Now I refuse to use non ""Metric"", and on that matter! Use the proper paper sizing!  A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, etc.....  I can't stand running into a Canada Post employee who doesn't know how paper is PROPERLY measured .

When you bake or cook?  Convert it!

Oh and don't let schools teach children anything else!"
"So the Canadian system is like the American one, but the road system is only in Metric"
Metric thermostats are half as accurate as imperial ones.
I'm not touching this debate with a 0.003048 km. pole.
"In Australia, absolutely everything is metric except for one thing. This one thing is only done in imperial because of American influence in recent decades. Australians will often use feet and inches to measure the height of an individual person, a lot of Australians will likely be able to tell you their height in centimetres but it’s much more common these days to use imperial exclusively for this measurement.

The widespread adoption could be due to feet and inches being seen as a more manageable number to read and conceptualise for example 6”0’ rather than 182cm but that’s just my speculation from personal lived experience."
"I grew up in Michigan. I live in Michigan. I was taught some metric measurements in 6th grade and then in physics, chemistry, and math class in 12th grade and astronomy class in college. I might have been taught that metric is ""better"". I really like the idea of preserving the tradition of using United States or English measurements. I don't care that metric is supposed to be better. I know a mile is 5280 feet, a foot is 12 inches, I measure my weight in pounds, my waist in inches, gas here is sold by the US gallon, the weight of cars in given in pounds, car wheels are measured in diameter in inches, computer screens are measured in inches, ten-pin bowling balls are measured in pounds, temperature is Fahrenheit, speed limits in miles per hour,  thermostats in my apartments were all in Fahrenheit, descriptions of apartments all just gave a number of square feet here. Yeah I know metric units are in multiples of ten. I had assumed that in Canada and in the United Kingdom, one day Metric units were mandated and the next day use of English units went extinct."
"Measuring properties in sqft is so insane to me, mostly becsuse of how small a sqft is"
Why you have a Mapuche flag!
"Slight nit-pick here. The S.I. unit of mass is not the same as the English system of *weight*. You called them both ""weight"". The difference is that the mass, measured by a balance  beam stays the same regardless of the amount of gravity. On the Moon I have the same mass as on earth. My weight however goes to 1/6 the amount of my earth weight as measured by a spring scale. The mass vs weight distinction becomes very apparent when you get to the basic unit of force in the metric system which is the newton, while in the english system it is the ""slug"". Needless to say, all science, engineering and medicine is done in S.I. even in these benighted areas where we still use the english system. Fun fact. The united states did lose a mars lander which crashed due to the software in one component somehow using english units where everything else used metric. Oops."
"Here in Spain we tend to use cm for day to day life, not mm although it's common to say 1cm and 7mm"
"Here in America, we mostly use a combination of imperial and metric, however some imported goods will have only metric given that they are shipped from only-metric countries. This causes incredible confusion, including goods like my favorite apple flavored soda, which comes in a 2-liter bottle, with no imperial conversion. It comes from, I believe, Venezuela of Columbia"
Yeah remember the metric and the Imperial system clashing on a NASA satellite going to Mars and it end up crashing into the planet and that was like a 100 million dollars down the toilet right then on there
"I never understand all the Europeans who actually get mad and think we’re dumb for using imperial. Like it’s just what we’re used to, just like you’re used to metric. And people always get mad because of things like a mile being 5280 feet, but nobody actually cares how long a mile is unless they’re doing a scientific measurement, because you just know the distance. If everything has to be designed for absolute efficiency then there’s a whole lot of other things that you’re dumb for not changing as well. For example not speaking Esperanto instead of English, French or any other language."
I remember reading this French history book while blamed Britain for foiling the universal adoption of the metric system. We also nicked time from them like the evil moustache twirling villains we are.
"6:48

Yea pretty much, we’re still in this awkward transition period where we use basically both. However, we veer more towards the metric system as its taught exclusively in schools, as opposed to the imperial system where we may have like a exam maths question on conversions or some crap."
"3:31 ""little platinum knob"" heh"
You forgot mentioning the metric system is more rational as based on a decimal scale. This is not more rational because of the basic unit choice
The imperial system is a reason I feel like I could never live in Canada or the US.
"Here in Australia, pretty much everything is metric except for our height which is more commonly still feet and inches, as well as the old people. I remember my Nan once asking me to help her just figure out a centimetre so she could do something (she's not senile or anything, just never learned it), and my step-pop knows millimetres because he's a builder. Even to this day though, I still know my height is 183cm and ~6ft."
"Half as precise, often, but a Celsius thermometer could easily be made that would report in half-degree steps.  Such a thermometer would be approximately the same precision as a Fahrenheit one.  Precision does not depend on units."
 @GH-oi2jf  definitely maters in a 2 digit display environment.
Do you have a camera?  Does it have a tripod mounting hole?  What size screw fits that hole?
 @GH-oi2jf  I don’t have a camera unfortunately.
" @haydenr5128  — Ok.  The answer, if you did have one, is 1/4-20 UNC.  Unless it is a large camera, in which case it might be 3/8-16.  Not metric."
" @GH-oi2jf  makes sense, Australia doesn’t make its own cameras (or really much of anything at all) I’m pretty sure they’re all imported."
"Depends on what you are measuring.  If you need to paint a wall, you measure in feet, rounding up to the next foot, to compute square feet.  A can of paint is marked for coverage in square feet.  It’s easy to see if you will have enough paint.  Yards (or meters) are too coarse.  If measuring land, we would use acres.  A large plot of land might given in whole acres, but a city lot would be a decimal fraction of an acre.  Any bulk material which might be delivered in a dump truck would be measured in yards, meaning cubic yards.  The unit depends on the context."
"NASA actually has an excellent record in unmanned space missions.  Evidence of that is that people wanting an example of a failure due to units mixup cite the same example, a quarter century later, over and over, and over, …."
"There is nothing inherently more “rational” about a decimal scale.  This is just stated here as a truth without any explanation of what that means.  Every scale of measurement we use has some thought behind it, so all are rational.  Rational thinking can lead to different solutions when there are different objectives."
" @GH-oi2jf  decimal is coherent with the way we count, isn’t it?"
" @guerriero92i  — Everybody world-wide uses decimal numbers.  That has nothing to do with which units one uses.  My objection is to your use of “rational.”  There is no metric for quantifying rationality, so it cannot be used objectively."
"We don’t use Imperial in the United States, so no worries."
"Just a little comment on construction in Canada - all of our blueprints and literature giving dimensions for materials for install do generally come with the information given primarily in metric. At least for the commercial and industrial construction I have taken part in across Alberta. It is easier to be more precise using mm rather than eighths and thirtysecondths , but either way there is one guarantee - your new apprentice won't know how to read EITHER side of the tape measure."
"Ok this video (and many others) made me mad because of how people say thousands, they normally say ""twelve hundred"". They never say ""240-hundred"" because that's silly.

At least be consitant."
"I think a main problem with metric vs. imperial and mixed systems is conversions. For example in an oven you might heat it up to 350 F, 400 F or 450 F, but in Celsius you'd heat it up to 150 C or 180 C or whatever, and those two numbers might not match up perfectly. Something similar happens with weight where one pound is not equal to 500 grams but rather about 454 g, and that can throw perfectly round numbers off in conversions"
"Metric is for lazy people.  All you need to do is shift the decimal point. Boring.  What can be more exciting that to remember 3 teaspoons to a tablespoon, 2 tablespoons to an ounce, 8 ounces to a cup, 2 cups to a pint, 2 pints to a quart and 4 quarts to a gallon?  Or who can forget 12 inches to a foot, 3 feet to a yard or 5280 feet to a mile? (Nobody I know needs to convert yards to miles.)"
"Except for measurement of weights.. your description of canadian metric imperial measurements totally resembles how it is here in india and damn.. its quite surprising how similar it is..

We always measure body temp. in Fahrenheit while all other stuff in celsius (mostly).. Heights are always measured in ft, unless its an official measurement. Weights are mostly always done in kgs in cities while in rural areas there are more traditional forms that resemble pounds. Land area is one hundred percent measures always in sq feet, and acres anywhere both official and casual discussions. Distance is an interesting concept.. while conversing in english we always use km.. but in my village they use miles in our language.. and also every single ruler (scale) has both cm and inches on it (never seen anything otherwise). Measurement of fruits and vegetables is more complicated.. most stuff is kgs.. but depending on area, stuff like bananas are measured in dozens.. and stuff like that. I live in Bangalore.. where even bananas are measured in kgs.. As for clothes and shoes, its a mess i don't wanna understand."
"It was probably a lot easier for the UK to transition to the metric system because they are so close to countries that use it and are somewhat familiar with it. Being from the US, I learned about the metric system. I could tell you the relationships between all the different units and prefixes, but I can't eyeball a meter or a kilogram like I can a foot or a pound, and even if I could, most people around me wouldn't so it wouldn't be all that useful. I think many Americans are in this same boat, and it makes it very difficult and not particularly useful to start using metrics."
"India is another of those weird multi-system countries.  They use both metric and imperial systems, but then also add in lakh and crore as descriptors for large amounts of whatever they are measuring."
"In Bangladesh, we measure everything official in SI units. But when we measure fever we use the Fahrenheit scale, for height we use ft&in, houses are in square feet while lengths are in Km etc. I guess no country is fully metric."
Just so you know you say human height in centimetres not meters
"The use of the metric system has been legal in the United States since 1866.  15 U.S.C. §§ 204 et seq.  Thus anyone who wants to use it is free to do so.  In many cases, changing over, just for the sake of change, would be a waste of time and money and likely would cause confusion.

For example, legal descriptions for real estate will always be in feet and acres, and they still are in Canada.  Attempting to convert them to metric would require everything to be resurveyed, and since the conversions would not be exact, the security of land titles would be jeopardized.

Measurements on a baseball field would not convert exactly.  For example, the distance between home plate and first base is 90 feet, which works out to 27.432 meters.  So, would we use 27 or 28?  Think of all the close plays in which a few inches made the difference.

I think the primary reason Canada converted to the metric system is the decision of Pierre Trudeau to appease the stiff-necked Québécois.  Pandering Pierre should have known better, since the QLF tried to overthrow the government anyway.

I have never understood why Britain, having put the French in their place in 1759, threw away the fruits of its victory by passing the Quebec Act in 1774.  The passage of the Quebec Act is condemned in the U.S. Declaration of Independence and was one of the grievances that led the Americans to rebel."
I instantly recognised you use a 20 NIS bill as a book mark. It’s cool seeing Israeli things in unexpected places. 😁
"Love it; love it when my wife sends me to the store to buy meat she tells me in pounds, then get to the grocery every label is in kilos"
"Yes like Australia. 

We use CM/MM (measuring distance or things small), mTON/KG/G/MG/MCG (any weight measurements), KM/M (measuring distance whilst driving or larger items).

And we are exactly the same as Canada in the Constitutional Monarchy with Brits aha"
4:16 what is this map?
"You realize we can just decide how big things are, right? We don't use millimeters or decimals, things are just... sized simply. That part was very confusing"
"In Australia it’s both, in height we use both depending on age, older people tend to use imperial. Also most of our nail and bolts are in impital but some are in metric."
"Whether the directive indicates six feet or two metres is largely relevant -
simply because in such circumstances - one does not need to be scientifically
accurate.
Using 'precise'  conversion only adds to the confusion.
The simple way is to STOP converting from Imperial to Metric and start
from scratch with Metric.

It is the ' Conversion' process that creates confusion.
Using Metric and having all weights and measures shown ONLY
in metric and people will soon become used to it.

To prove how stupid the US Politicians are - I will use examples of
""ELEVATION  and DEPTH of water.

(2000 ft) they converted to 609.6m
It would be certain that the elevation is NOT exactly 2000 feet - and
has been rounded off to the NEAREST FOOT - yet these failed brain damaged
politicians fail to round off the metric measurement to 610 metres.

The same applies to the ""WATER-> depth of (50 ft)"" which in  reality maybe
50 feet and 5 inches - thus rounded off at the NEAREST Foot to 50 feet.
Had those politicians been as 'intelligent' as they imagine them-selves
to be they would round off the depth to 15 Metres -  in such cases an
accurate scientific measure is not required unless one is working in
Engineering - which requires PRECISE measurements.

With the volume and weight of food - ONLY Metric measurements are to be labelled.
People are intuitive by nature and can see what the volume is and what
weight something is - and become accustomed to it very quickly.
Converting from one to the other causes a mental problem.
So STOP converting the measurements and torturing yourselves.

Search for 'THE CODE OF LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'
§205b clause (1) states:
To designate the metric system of measurement as the preferred system
of weights and measures for the United States Trade and Commerce.

Since 1994 both Metric and US customary units have been required to be 
shown on labels and packaging. 
The US currency is the Metric system - Do you all have trouble with that ?

Paper for example is manufactured to an inter-related mathematical formula.
One can fold an A3 sheet of paper in half - and it becomes an A4 size
sheet of paper - which perfectly into an A4 Stapler.
Or fold it once more and it will become A5 size sheet - which fits into
an A5 envelope.
Rules are graduated in centimetres mainly - because it's more often used

Millimetres are only used in math classes and engineering where precision

Checkered paper is also be normalized so that 4 clustered squares

"Weirdly enough in Germany, right in the heart of generally completely metric Europe plumbing measures, TV screen diameters and often trousers sizes are usually given in ""Zoll"" (i.e. inch), and it's not uncommon to have measuring tapes with inches and millimetres, thermometers with Celsius and Fahrenheit and scales that you can at least switch to something weird like pounds.
So even in countries where everybody thinks metric all of the time there are some areas where tradition or old industry customs still adhere to older systems and some where imperial units are given for reasons of globalisation."
"Here in Mexico we all use centimeters for most things
Using millimeters is considered kinda nerdy because it's considered too precise for regular people to care about. At most we use 5mm (half centimeter), otherwise nobody cares.
Aside from that it's mostly normal in terms of metric units: Kilometers, Meters, Centimeters, Kilograms, Grams, Milligrams, Liters, Millilitres...
And also a bunch of schools teach how to convert to imperial because USA won't teach metric so if we want to trade we have to learn that darn system. Though nobody uses it in their normal lives."
"I'm a young brit myself and the situation here is truly just a mess of the two systems. I measure distances in miles, meters and cm but I also use yards when I'm in a car because thats what the sat nav always said when I was growing up. As for area it is typically square meters but also often sq ft instead. our measuring tapes and school rullers have both ft & inches and meters & cm. I only ever use litres and mililitres for liquids. Milk specifically though is measured in both litres and pints, the label will often say both pints and litres and of course beers are measured solely in pints As for body measurements I measure my height in ft and inches but my weight in kg and waist measurements are in cm. I also often find that I'm in the minority when it comes to using kg for body weight, only my swedish friend doesn't ask me 'what is that in stone/pounds' when I speak about body weight. Also it seems that meters are used for height limits in theme parks and also by doctors. The only thing truly condistent is the use of celsius for temperature  I've spoken to both american and euopean friends about the topic and they do say that it is a confusing, strange situation but it seems only a small minority of wierd brits like myslef actually care, everone else just is used to it and uses wgatever system"
"When you want to be precise using English measures, you use decimal fractions.  Surveyors will work in feet, tenths, and hundredths.  A hundredth is about three mm."
" @GH-oi2jf  I’m aware, just those are not dimensions given on shop drawings and blueprints as far as I’ve ever seen."

"I think that's an important observation. Most (if not all) countries on Earth still use traditional units for some purposes, so there may not be any full metric nations."
"I think that depends on where you are from exactly? I'm from a 100% metric country and we always say human heights in meters, like ""I am one seventy"" (1.70m)"
"What? The Zoll thing is true, but I have never seen a measuring tape with inches or a thermometer with Fahrenheit anywhere in Germany."
There is nothing wrong with knowing more than one way of measuring something.
"When I first left the U.S. (starting in New Zealand) back in 1991, I was put out by the metric system.....for about a day.  Once that's the system in use, you get used to it lightning fast, and it's a lot easier to use.  Celsius took the longest to get used to, I think, but even that one I adjusted to fairly quickly.  The problem with that one was that the difference between two degrees of celsius is much bigger than the difference between two degrees of fahrenheit. But I adjusted to that pretty quickly too.  In China, weights in the market had their own local measurements, but since they corresponded pretty closely to the metrics, it was pretty easy to adjust to one ""jin"" being .5kg."
"i didnt even know grams was metric. idk if its just cause me and my family moved here from Europe, but we very commonly use grams even though we use imperial for everything else. I always thought everyone in America uses grams"
"i dont think celsius is metric nor SI. also metric isnt the same as SI. metric includes SI derived units which are not SI units themselves, such as km/h. the SI unit for speed is m/s because metre is SI and second is SI, but kilometre is metric and hour is not SI at all, so km/h cannot be SI."
"for me growing up in the UK we are not taught the Imperial system, only metric, so my dad says its 100 degrees outside and till this day it takes me a min to realise he means fahrenheit, i am 21 its the same for all our generation, no one knows how long a yard is, or what a gallon roughly is, we only know metric. therefore there is a massive age divide and only old people know how to use imperial and only young know how to use metric."
I hate that the UK measures fuel in Litres but fuel efficiency in Miles Per Gallon
I mean that volume of water that represents the kg was 1000 cubic centimetres.  Then things like the units of force and energy are all derived from the kilogram and the metre (also the second).  It’s pretty neutral.
no one uses meters as a hight measurement on humans(atleast i dont) centimeters are the best its way better just to say i am 182 insted of i am 1.82 meters
what no research does to a mfer
Fun fact small amounts of weed is sold in metric and large amounts are sold in imperial.
"in mexico rulers have inches although we never used them, I might say almost no one knows what they are. exept the mandatory convertion classes that makes us hate gringos."

"Don't forget drugs.  Jesus.  What a wreck there.  Pot was sold in ounces in larger quantities .. fractions of ounces (half oz, quarter ounce, one eigth ounce).  Any smaller and it's suddenly in grams.  And most any pothead knows 1/8oz = 3.5g, .. half is 14g... Ounce is 28g.. 

Then alcohol even though we CALL IT a ""fifth"" of a gallon, it's actually 750mL"
fascinating!
I've been seriously considering the fantastic beasts steels. The 4k ones are too expensive though so I think I'll go for the bluray
You will love the Malko Steelbook protectors. I use them. Malko just got there 4K/Blu-ray slipcover protectors back in stock and I bought 100 of those.
"Midsommer is a disturbing film, if you liked Hereditary then you will probably like this!  also reminded me of the original Wickerman, one time watch for me!"
"The George Melees disc looks cool! ""Trip To The Moon"" is it's usual title. Have to give a shout out to Martin Scorcese's Hugo, as it really is more a history lesson on George Melee than anything. Was that Enter The Void you also got? That's a STRANGE movie! Great in it's visuals, but goes on a journey that's really unsettling. Good haul! :)"
"Watch1917.  

Personally I didn’t enjoy midsommer at all."
Estaría genial y original que hicieras un video en español mostrando tus películas  Mexicanas o de habla hispana favoritas
Enter the void will blow your mind. Best blind buy pick up
Yeah I went for the bluray steelbook since it was cheap. Maybe I will add the 4k disc in the future
"I am going to review them here shortly, seem good so far"
Now I am more interested in Midsommar. Thanks for the heads up.
"That is it Hugo where I learned more about Melees, The other is Enter the Void, I am excited to watch it, I love those trippy movies like Tree of Life and The Fountain, thanks for watching."
"Just be careful with Enter The Void around the wife and child, as it gets pretty dark and disturbing with drugs and sex. Yet Gaspar Noe captures it with such brilliance, it's hard not to look away."
"I watched Shazam and then 1917, OMG my wife was crying, I was bummed out, such a great movie, mind you I am a veteran."
"Roland Romero - When a movie has an impact like that on someone. You know it’s good ! 

I did get the 4K myself the other day.  May watch it over the next few days."
"Tengo un canal en Spanish jajaja se llama A todo Comics pero no me se todos los nombres en Español, gracias por ver el video."
Now I really want to watch it. Thank you
Made me laugh but so awesome!
"Next one needs to be ""Afternoon Delight""...thank you in advance."
This makes the adrenaline in my blood rush so much that my face might peel off

"I grew up as a fan during this time. You missed a lot of information and context. Mourning was traded because there was a big fight between Mourning and Johnson. They chose to trade Mourning because the drafted Johnson first, but then LJ requested a trade a year later. The Kobe trade was agreed upon first. He never wanted to play in Charlotte."
LAmelo has this under control 🛸🕺🏾
So it’s like a browns ravens thing except with less angry fans.
"To me the sad thing is this we have unc duke 
But never had a great nba team i few were good in the 90s but not good enuf like we are like the browns of the nfl
But i still hope we get better it woukd be nice to have a good nba team"
I feel like they were on a good trajectory but went astray when they traded Mourning for Rice. Rice was a great player but Mourning went on to have a lot of success with the Heat afterwards. Miami won that trade.
Loved the Hornets history recap. Nice job. The ending was great too.
"Jordan was smart enough to drop the Bobcats name & go back to the Charlotte roots renaming/rebranding as the HORNETS, That cost nearly $100Million"
No Jordan can't.
"Hornets never won anything with mourning, so swapping him out for Glen rice was irrelevant"
"Alonzo was what I call a second-tier star he was below Ewing, Robinson, Olajuwan throughout the 90's.  He could never beat the Knicks outside of that '97 series where suspensions determined the outcome.  Ultimately Miami could not win with him as a franchise player. It took getting Dwade and then trading for Shaq for them to finally win a title.  Charlotte would not have won a title with ZO as the main guy."
That was a good move. Very important for the historic value of the franchise.
 @PurplePrinceNBA  they made it worse by lossing shit ton of games so no.
Hell yeah CSGO!!!!! Let’s gooooo😄
You've created a brilliant device for overcoming smartphone addiction! I stopped using a smartphone in January of 2020 because as a creative I really felt like it was robbing me of valuable time that I could use to make music. I recently made this music video https://youtu.be/muHOhIrHO98 that explores how my smartphone used to make me feel (i.e. crazy) and also the eventual decision I made to stop using one. Looking forward to seeing what other cool Arduino inventions you come up with!
Funny as very cool! :-)
Mark rober and you should do a colab
Subscribed. Look forward to what's next.
Great videos. Very underrated channel.
Why r u so underrated? I’m confused.
You remind me of Mark Rober! Definitely a good thing! keep up the awesome videos!
"Hey, can you share it on github?"
"But your phone was in you pocket at the end :) :) :). You are right, I reduced my social media down to YT only, and try to ignore notifications."
the irony of watching this video on my phone on a youtube binge...
"Love the experiment, and the Mark Rober-style video. Keep it up!"
"Great idea & invention bro, this is a real problem we all do face and need to confront."
This is cool! Would be great to share STLs and design info on Thingiverse or elsewhere
Great invention...
"Open your phone’s Settings app.
Tap Digital Wellbeing & parental controls.
Under “Your Digital Wellbeing tools,” tap Show your data."
Amazing concept for a problem many of us face. Maybe this will get me to dig up my Arduino again to recreate something similar.
Let's sub this guy. Great idea and engineering. Very humble. Rare these days!
"So in your control, that was only from 9 to 5, correct?"
This is so cool! Any sort of repo or resource with technical details?
"code: bugs
72,942 $1 donations:"
Appreciate that :)
Thanks Parcival! You'll love the video coming out in a few weeks!
Hi! What are you looking for specifically? PayPal endpoint? Arduino code?
Thanks a lot Snowy!
Great to hear from you Rishi!! Hope you liked it :)
Great idea. I added a link to the description where you can download the STLs. Hope it helps :)
Thanks!!
Is that on Android or iOS? I couldn't find it on iOS but iOS does have something similar to view your usage stats
" @nick_ohara  I am currently using Xiaomi. Not familiar with ios actually. But cool project, pls don't take my words offensive 👍👍"

That's right!
"Thanks! I'd be happy to share the code, 3D model, and list of parts I used. Would anything else be useful?"
Wow very nice
Very impressive all round mate and inspiring. I look forward to more!
Great and may I know do you miss any very important notification in that time
"Excellent video and topic, Nick! Perfect pace for making all the relevant points while moving it along and keeping my full attention. Your charity choice and ending were great too.  Hard to believe this was your first video.  Glad Jason shared it w/ us.  Looking forward to more."
"Nice video
Watched it on my cellphone"
"You have 56 subscribers holy i thought you would have atleast 100, 000 by the quality of this video keep up the good work"
I like it.
Awesome video!
Well done!

"Please elaborate on wtf these videos are. 

Amazing, I like them, but wtf...."
Theis is SOO good
Love your vids :D
Description says his interactions are mixed with fiction to make it funny. just fyi
"Lucid dreaming is the ""art"" of knowing one is dreaming while they are dreaming.  It's cool, because with practice, you can basically do what you want.  Like be a super hero or ""talk"" with your crush and stuff"

Imagine having to fix that transmitter on top of the Empire State Building? Just a bit too high up for me.
Oddly fascinating. I love all things 70s.
And that was the signal for me to finally go to bed
"at 4:41, I swear I can feel air coming from my speaker at high volume"
"4:41 It is tough to figure out what the tone is saying. Some ay BOO, YOO BRUUUU"
why do they have a flag waving from the 1950s or 60s.
"If i watched this before bed, i would have nightmares"
America flag was the sign of peace and freedom but in 2022 I just don't know anymore😔
I miss when channels signed off.
The flag was based of sign off of KING.
This audio was based by WNBC and WJLA.
I'm sorry I took this for granted when I was a youngster. So much easier back then.
4:37 TV Color Bars
"The rainbow bars sounded less well
ear drum destroying"
No test pattern?
That low hum color screen is weird
"WNET OPENING SEPTEMBER 14, 1995"
I was just 3.
"Does anyone remember something like this in the late 70's. I'm thinking of a NY station (maybe WPIX) that after the late night signoff which I'm remembering to be about 2 or 3am, the station would go to black with some static sounds for a short time but then would transfer over to  a late night movie from another network. I'm assuming the channel was shared by two networks with the one taking over after the original network signed off. I distinctly remember this and I think it was WPIX but I could be wrong."

In a strange way the station is telling us to go to bed.
An American flag in front of a fan... that’s the least creative video for a national anthem I’ve ever seen.
"God,Country and Family"

And toon wet thats wettoon ABS CBN Sign off 5/5/20 Tue
"That sign off sound used to scare the crap outta me as a kid, now, not so bad"
4:38 That escalated quickly
"I was too scared to ""tapthat,"" even though the screen dared me to. :-)"
Whoever this guy was who did the VO also did the closing VO for the Yule Log's 1971 airing (see my clip here on YT)
"It was first sign on on June 15, 1948"
WPIX 11 is the CW Affiliate stations in New York city
8:08
8:9::0
I know the announcer. :-)
I was in early 90s that brocast
"Anyone ever hear in the 70's on WPIX that ""Those YANKEES are ALIVE!!!!""?🙂"
Perfect.  That's how I remember it.
"Ilham Nobi Entertainment - either from a YT video or from Cable TV or satellite in most places throughout the Caribbean Basin, as its' satellite signal did reach into Colombia and Venezuela (not counting every country from Mexico through Panama and the whole Caribbean).

That's how TBS wound up creating FANBASE for the Atlanta Braves, PIX to the New York Yankees and Mets (different years) and WGN to the Chicago Cubs throughout Latin America..."
it was thrown on in a hurry by the tone distortion
That does indeed sound like the same guy.
What was his name?
Alfredo Santos
They were late moving to wtc
I wish we could go back to those days.
"I miss the days when they played the National Anthem on TV, before & after they broadcast, nowadays it's a infomercial wasteland."
@ 4:39 uh oh... I think I have to go pooooooooooooooooooooop!!!
ok but why did i find the boooooooooooooooooooooooop sound satisfying for some reason? my friend would've shot up the tv and trash her cable real quick😳
"I love the USA
♥️"
"After this, the Denver station would play the poem High Flight (One of my Dad's favorite, as he was an Air Force Pilot)"
The music at the beginning is kind of errie.
And now star tuned for.......complete silence.
WPIX-FM is now a simulcast of WFAN-AM 660
"Yeah, I miss that time when u listened to that salute of our nation & you had no option but to lie down & catch some z's now every station is in 24 hr mode. I mean what the heck happened?"
"Used to doze off then as soon as you heard that national anthem my ass was like "" oh shit what time is it? """
Does anyone else find tv sign offs in general a little unsettling?
"I remember that ""fluttering flag"" anthem on WPIX. Back then every station in New York had a distinct audio of the anthem, with different accompanying visuals. One station, I forget which, had a Moog synthesizer version with a montage of stills depicting events in American history, done in chronological order."
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Oml this is literally the process: first the creepy song , then the National Anthem, then they go AFK for a LOOOOOOONG Time, and then the color bars show up for the rest of the night. Wowwwww"
4:39 Jumpscare
Why did it had minutes befor color bars? Maybe they went to have some coffee?
"2:37-4:41 ""what took them so long? where they out having a smoke? oh wait ITS  a BOOOOO tone. Ok ""ME"" I guess they waited till I had a tobacco pipe then wobble is Sine wave for ""Sorry to keeping you waiting but get over it"""
Brings back memories.  Saw it many times. I had B&W TV then.
"Me,too!"
"I was all of 3 at the time. I know this is a cliché, but where did the time go? 🥴🤯"
4:39 its sounds like Im trying to poop nah on 2nd thought it sounds like Im trying to POOOOOOP a brick
"Ugh, cable. Uncool."
I love the 400hz tone as it comforts me
 @ohhistevie  ik me and my fam switched to roku tv and amazon fire tv since then 😭
they always used to make me feel like there was some kind of crisis and it also felt very lonely and isolating for some odd reason............woke my ass up after watching half a flick so I could shut off the tv tho lol
The SSB clip here is rather unnerving
ONLY WHEN STATIC IS THERE but Colour bars no I find them a delight and an honer when 400hz is played
too much poltergeist? ;)
Poltergeist has nothing to do with it as Colour bars were not used for the ghost's gateway. I watch these for colour bars and tone 1000 or 400hz esp. 400hz and I LOVE THAT TONE. Sounds like my Australian accent
"Yeah, pretty hard to describe. Like, it perfectly captures the empty streets of the city where few are still awake...but yeah, there's a loneliness to them."
 @3hooks781  both tones have each other so they are never really loney
 @flatcapman  You know something? I think you're right. LOL! Cheers!
 @3hooks781  Thanks. I do listion to thr 400hz tone here as it calms me down or if I want to wake up the 1000hz one does that. I really hate static and all that does is anger me
 @3hooks781  Well put!
Both WOR and WABC used that one at different points in time.
THANK YOU
with the trademark Australian BOOOOOOOO to the bars the wobble at the start sounds like it ran in the door Late
BOOOOOOOOOOO
"or ""HEY HOW'S IT GOING?"" Your ""Your having a wild colour day"" Me ""FUNNY Check out my no 1 Australian hit.. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"""
"4:39 More like ""Took me long enough. What was I doing? Having a smoke before I ran in and toned?"""
"I think they were on a ciggie and coffee break then realised ""nothing on the screen PUT THE RAINBOW AND AUSSIE TONE ON"""
 @flatcapman  haha
 @keithmoon3190  It's clearly rushed in by the tone distortion at the start
 @flatcapman  agreed
 @keithmoon3190  I have listioned to that tone since childhood. Its the only tone that calms me down
"What was it with those Indian head test patterns anyway!They either played that continuous tone,some area radio station or even crazier,elevator music! It was really bizarre even back then!"
Jumpscare 4:39
"Ok, WHY they need national antams to sigh off?!"
"So...there were no shows after? What were you supposed to do after everything went off? Sorry, I was born in 1990."
"Music heard in the background comes from part of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" by the Alan Parsons Project, on their debut album 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination', based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe."
And for the beep at 4:39...........########################### SHUT UP UGH
nobody talks or hears the National Anthem anymore why?
well thank you
"Ah, our National Anthem, back when America's citizens were proud of it and willing to fight for it.  Today they just look the other way...  :-("
"A wy, patrzcie na to!  Tańczący żywy pasek na ciemnym ekranie, robi się czarny i ekran! 2:37 Najzabawniejsza rzecz na świecie. Kciuki w górę"
"I'm don't get scared. But when I do, it's because of this. "
4evernate28 that song has taken over my day.  Thank you for introducing it and all its glory to me. 
At what point do the color bars come on in this video?
Pbs
"I can remember in the early 80s.
Alot of the TV stations would sign off at midnight. 
There was no programming from midnight to like 6 or 7 am.
This was before the info commericals. "
"What I never quite understood, even as a little guy in the mid 70's....is why they broadcast that multi-color test screen all night long after they signed off?  I mean they had to actually BROADCAST it so why not just put on some programming instead???  Right?"
Never thought I'd actually want to see one of these sign offs. But actually I kinda like it. It actually seems to bring closure to my viewing day. I may play it again tomorrow night to help me get to sleep :-)
Wpix operates in 7AM-12MN
"You mean 4:40. That sound is the test pattern tones, and test pattern tones are very relaxing. They can even calm down crying babies."
@1:20 I believe that's the US Army Herald Trumpets doing the National Anthem.
Oops! 4:40!
I'm sorry about that I was doing MY JOB so sue me. Oh wait THAT NEVER WORKS with test patterns.
"Jorell Romero It was customary for TV stations to play the National Anthem as a sign of respect, just like when they play it before the beginning of any sporting event."
Jorell Romero It's the same all countries when a station signs on and off the air
When were you born??
Every country plays their national anthem on TV to show respect for their country.
"Viewers either went to bed or switched to another station that stayed on all night. This was back in 1979, and 24-hour TV channels wouldn't be a regular thing until well into the 1990's. It was a very different time back then. Watching a TV show on demand via the Internet is only a recent development in the past few years."
"Good point. There was no digital cable like now, i.e CNN, ESPN etc was just getting starting by end of 1979 into 1980. Thus at least in NYC area, I don't think any of the then 7 channels of ABC, NBC CBS and WPIX, WNEW(Fox network did not start until 1986)and PBS/Channel 13 would be on 24/7. If you lucky a station like WPIX would stay on the air until 4am. 

Richard is correct. It be until the early 1990's at least here in NYC that then free channels would all be 24/7. Channel 13 the local PBS being the last one to go all night. Now over 20 years later it's all infomericals lol."
By your time they were showing lousy infomercials till the next day.
Emily Kosovik-Jeffery read a book or go to bed or turn on your Atari game system and play games like I did until I went to sleep!!!
I was born in 2008 so it’s all good
that's not the high pitched Beep that's more like BOOOOOOOOOO was this thing having an orgasm? No wonder this sound attracts Super Mario Boos. They think the TV is talking to them in BOO-ISH
It was useful in waking my ass up so I could shut the tv off. I'm sure many of us had that experience after dozing off only watching half a movie and then the next thing we heard was either the anthem or the tone ; )
What do you mean?
True :'(
Kain Nosgoth Huh???
The American Anthem is a song of pride and a reminder that Americans should never forget where they come from. It has a powerful and deep message most don't grasp today sadly and sounds way better then the crap Australian Anthem that sounds like it was written by a drunk Bogan while sitting on the toliet
***** when put into context it makes sense.Anything like that can lose the creepy factor over time 
those were the days...when the national anthem meant something to me...but that is fading away :(
"With all the support the troops stuff on the air, cannot see what your saying."
"Yeah, we all miss that salute to our nation, too bad they went 24-hr mode"
"yeah, there is a lot of support for the troops on the air but its usually form only half of the country.   The other half thinks it's a waste of time and money and the funds could be used for ""better"" things...."
The Anthem is quite dull and pathetic. @flatcapman 
" @gtc1961  It IS a waste of time and the funds would be better used for other means, such as space exploration."
 @ohhistevie  Agreed. We should have a better anthem.
"Yes. I may be fabulous, but our world sure isn't. cry_sniff_loop"
"In 1979?! This was the era post-Vietnam and around the time of the Iran hostage-taking, when the U.S. was doing a lot of national soul-searching."
Uhhh WTF are you even saying? Sorry I cant really understand you since I’m american
and its not the high pitched one its more a BOOOOOOOO
"Lloyd Duff, you're talking about the low-pitched tone!"
Joe Orsini Yes usually its a med to high pitch so it's different here I have seen a colour bar parody where its going BOOOOOO and Super Mario Boos are thinking its calling their name floating around the bars with happy smiles like they enjoy the tone
"+Dan Livni WPIX ran programming all night during the 1970s and 1980s.
Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, Action News (repeat), the Channel 11 Film Festival, Biography, Laurel And Hardy or The Abbott And Costello Show, and Biography. The sign-off was usually for about an hour or less between 5 and 6am, and would resume with cartoons and/or religious programming at 6-6:30."
"+Tommy Retro&#39;s Blast From The Past! 
Yes you&#39;re right.
I also remember Pat Harper was one of the top female broadcasters on PIX in the 70s to mid 80s.
I also remember the sports guy in the late 70s and 80s Jerry Girard. 
Both were great on the air. Sadly both passed away.
Pat in 94 from a heart attack. Jerry in 2007 from cancer."
"@ Tommy Retro Your 70s information is wrong. I have some TV Guides from the 70s. WPIX usually had a two-hour movie at midnight, then a 30 minute newscast. Shut down at 2:30, then resumed at 7 a.m."
 @amightysailingman  have photos of said tv guides
"Maybe in smaller markets they did, but NYC and other bigger markets most stations (particularly independents) stayed on the air well into the early morning hours, especially on weekends."
"Because that would've required people to actually be there at the station to be directors (to start movies or tapes), after all computers doing just that weren't there in those times (at least not in The Netherlands).
I'm not sure how test-signals were generated in America because the television system is really a lot different in The Netherlands, but here our national (and also some local and regional) television stations switched off their feed-signals after signing off at which test-pattern and test-tone generators kicked in automatically, so basically it wasn't the station broadcasting and delivering the feed with the test pattern.
But then again, television really is different in my country compared to America, allthough there are similarities on some parts."
I used to think the same thing!  Now they just put on infomercials!
"They didn't broadcast the test pattern all night. It was just on for a few minutes after sign-off then a few minutes before sign-on. If you tuned in during the dead time in between, you'd see and hear static because there was no signal."
They actually said that it would be too expensive at the time to broadcast all night
The existence of the color bars and tone also was to provide engineer and technicians at the stations master control with the opportunity to adjust the visual/aural output. You might never have noticed because those adjustments would have been very subtle.
I thought I was the only One!
I miss them myself. Glad to see it again.
4:40 That is a 400HZ Sine wave tone to SMPTE colour bars
"They can even calm down crying babies.


pffft."
 @flatcapman  is on g scale
I so miss that sound at :40!!!!!
Etvvrtyu
Yep. I remember this....was 17 at the time....stayed up late often!
I was born in 1979!!!!
"The first scene scared me, but the logo in the darkness scared me even more and the music in the background (The first song) scared me even more! <:O"
Too bad stations don't do this anymore.  Now they just run endless loops of infommercials.
"AMERICA, FUCK YEAH !"
The off-air screen is my favourite TV program in the world.
lol tap that
"So, I'm NOT the only one who finds this just a little scary?"
"Yeah. WPIX did not signoff the air for very long at all, when they did actually signoff, which I recall wasn't every night. I do remember this signoff, however upon seeing it again.  "
TUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
The INTV logo seen at 1.04 is very similar to one used by ITV in the UK around this time.
I'm from NY and I do remember when TV stations signed off for the evening. That's was way before those infocomericals took over the over night hours and 24/7 broadcasts.
"I've found out all but one of the remaining translators, thus:
WCBS-TV: W53AA (now WKOB-LD)
WNBC-TV: W57AB
WNEW-TV: W64AA
WABC-TV: W66AA
WOR-TV: W71AK
WNET: W75AM
WNJU: W62AA
WTVG/WWHT: W60AI
Only WNYC-TV (whose translator was on Channel 79) is a question mark at this time."
"@shobielim - Can you advise as to the calls of the other New York TV station translators (i.e. Ch. 53 for WCBS-TV 2, Ch. 66 for WABC-TV 7) as of '79?"
"The was recorded via the station's translator W73AP, now WEBR-CD in 1979"
"@MIKON8ERISBACK 

Make sure you respond to the right person. I never said it didn't."
"@RoyKnable Only thing good on the CW now is Smallville.  When the network first launched after the UPN-WB ""wedding,"" it had three good shows, Smallville, Everybody Hates Chris, and WWE SmackDown.  SmackDown's still doing well.  The CW, on the other hand...they've since lost Everybody Hates Chris, and Smallville's about to end.  So after this season, there won't be shit left."
"@TimelordR The only way you can get WPIX outside of the NYC area these days is in Atlantic City.  The only problem, practically the entire schedule is blacked out due to Syndex.  From what I understand, it's also available on New England cable systems in areas lacking a CW affiliate, but again, the syndicated shows are blacked out due to Syndex.  And then there's Dish Network, where it's available with no blackouts in the Superstations package."
"Well, they operate 24/7. And it's due to digital television."
"Many if not most stations eliminated sign-offs way back in the analog TV age. I know the ones in my area had stopped by the mid 1990s. It just wasn't worth the problems that sometimes happened when trying to restart systems at 6 a.m. So it cost a thousand dollars in electricity to keep going a couple of more hours. They could lose more than that with just a few minutes of ""technical difficulties"" during sign-on."
Good news for people who sleep with the TV set on. In 2003 most stations are now operating 24/7.
An eternity of useless products to rot your sceavy little mind....FOREVER!
The FCC required sign-offs until 1997.
"In Bangladesh, all channels run 24/7 with actual shows."
in japan.  they sign off on networks
I hate infomercials. I rather the channel sign off and then wake up later.
The Jetsons is one of my favorite tv programmes in the world.
"I remember being scared by sign-offs as a kid, but now I miss them and wish I could find the ones of my childhood stations again."
"WHAT THE F*CK?? TUUUU? I thought the tone said ""DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE"" It said my tone says BOO or DOOT but TU is a 1st. Do you think Im saying TWO? You make me sound like a drawn out spitting as in ""1 (spits) TWOOO TWOO"""
"@RoyKnable - And even WPIX's newscasts have become second-rate (or lower) - in fact, its presentation (which seems to match parent Tribune's bankruptcy) is worse than what is oft associated with public-access TV production values.  From gold standard to cheap cubic zirconium in about a generation.  Jodi Applegate?  Please.  She can't even come remotely close to what Pat Harper exemplified."
"@TimelordR 
You're not missing anything. It's no longer the independent station you miss. Just another affiliate of a second-rate network now."
What a same they no longer offer WPIX on Cable TV anymore like they did back in the 80's. I'd watch it.
@4evernate28  just listened to the original song. nice.
"@4evernate28 - More precisely, the part from 0:15 to 1:22 on:
watch?v=Q2sHm0g14UM
Now, what's the music played towards the end of the sign-off and before the SSB? That's now the $64,000 question . . . "
"@4evernate28 - Nice to know this.  Now the only mystery is who's the voice of this sign-off? (Again, it sure ain't Bill Biery, Ralph Lowenstein or even Roy Whitfield - was it perhaps one of WPIX-FM 102's DJ's of the time?)"
"Just in case anyone's curious, the background music is the Alan Parsons Project's Pavane, from their debut album Tales Of Mystery And Imagination. Once I heard that, I was bugging. XD"
"@noahf67 - Since the 50-star flag was first unveiled in 1960, and WPIX started airing in color in 1965, and the Army ""SSB"" rendition as used for this film dated back to probably 1963, it would appear this film was from the late 1960's (and as aired here, very much faded by this point).  Besides, WPIX didn't sign on until 1948."
"@NEPatriot - Oh, the recording was the ""Army SSB"" all right. I'm referring to the films themselves."
@wmbrown6  And to think I called it the Army SSB.  
"The ""SSB"" film played for years by WPIX appears to have gotten around on other stations.  A small snippet of this film (albeit a better-kept copy) was played at the end of the ""SSB"" film of KING Channel 5 in Seattle as of 1987, per:
watch?v=g66AySFDCyM
As for the film ran for years by WNBC and other stations - it has been referred to by Wikipedia as the ""Mount Vernon SSB"" exactly due to what 'fromthesidelines' described.  Except this recording (my favorite of all) was the U.S. Army Band's."
"In ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" sequence, the SAME soundtrack was also used in Channel 4's [WNBC-TV] version at that time- featuring ""travelogue scenes"" of Washington D.C. and its monuments, and a brief shot of the U.S. Marine Corps Band supposedly performing this..."
@wmbrown6 - I see at the 2:01 point of this video the flag film cross-dissolves into a loop (I use this technique too when necessary). It does seem to have the same film 'feel' of the Yule Log film loop. This was before Soft-Box bounce lighting. The old 60's Days of Our Lives opening has that similar film and lighting look too.
"@OreckBoy1 - I have seen WPIX ""leave the air until tomorrow"" many times - but not like this.  For the most part they had this ""11 Alive"" ID slide (or, if pre-1976, the prior ID slide with the original ""circle 11"" logo), no music, and Bill Biery (pre-recorded) reading the sign-off script - which started off with ""At this time..."" and, promo'ing WPIX-FM, referring to ""the best in contemporary music."""
@OreckBoy1 it is a freat find. the music alone gives a whole different feel to the sign-off. RAOS is the man.
"Many were the nights when (at the 4:40 mark in this video) a bleary-eyed young man (me) would rise from the sofa, shut off the set and go to bed. I miss this and I'm not even sure why. Maybe I just miss the idea that the world had powered down for the night. Thank you, TapThat. Your uploads kick ass and this is a great find indeed."
"@MSTS1 - It did seem that the production of that ""SSB"" seemed to mirror that of ""The Yule Log,"" because :38 into this film it crossfaded - in other words it was a loop. Wonder if 'PIX itself produced this film, given that no other TV station that I know of had the ""SSB"" in this specific form."
"@DanZero77 - Can't say for sure . . . but if WNEW were an INTV member, they certainly didn't advertise it!"
WPIX-FM... the station that didn't know what format to identify itself with!!!!!! I am willing to say that was a radio-style announcer there.
"@wmbrown6 Now that I've also seen that WPIX was also an AITV member, was WNEW ever one?"
"wmbrown6 In 1970s, there were Pat Harper and Stephen Bosh. In 1980s, there were Brad Holbrook, Ralph Loweinstein, and Sheila Steinback. In 1990s, there were Marvin Scott, Tim Malloy, Jack Cafferty, and Kaity Tong. In 2000s, there have been John Muller, Lynn White, Marisol Castro, Sukanya Krishnan, Craig Salvatore, Tiffany Mckelroy, Jim Watkins, Peter Thorne, Mary Murphy, Larry Hoff, and Melinda Lopez. Now, there are Tamsen Fadal, Scott Stanford, Kori Chambers, Jodi Applegate, Dan Marciano, Kirsten Nicole, others who still never equal the success and legacy of two of New York's news legends, Pat Harper and Kaity Tong."
Very Good!!
"Original 1976 Edition, no less."
It's from 1969
"That one's pretty rare. I love that studio-shot flag with the fan blasting on it, and maybe a prod. assistant lying on the floor out of frame shaking the mast; that's  unique.. nice clip"
@RolloSmokes the search never ends my friend!
@gli7utubeo hav a friend helping with the search. shout to him!
@RolloSmokes - My money's on the latter (one of the 'PIX-FM jocks of the period; but it's just a matter of which one).
"@wmbrown6 Either it's a really laid-back Lowenstein, or perhaps a 'PIX-FM jock."
"I have now seen everything.

TAP THIS!!!!"
Thanks. This is really great. Best to you for finding this.
"This particular ""SSB"" film, in its image, seems an update of a film from the 1940's, per:
watch?v=fCw2Q-t8g5o"
"@tapthatt2012 - As to the music heard over the promo for WPIX-FM, I remember that music from ads for the station at the time.  As for the other background music - I'm as interested as you are.  Sounds almost New Age-y.  I'm wondering if one of WPIX-FM's DJ's from that rock format did this sign-off.  Sounds like one of them.  Just a question of who."
@wmbrown6 any idea what music is playing behind him? never heard that voice before.
"It should be noted that pre-1978, the sign-off (with no music, and voiceover by Bill Biery) ended with this notice: ""May we suggest if you'd like to spend some time listening to the best in contemporary music, you tune to WPIX-FM, 102 on your FM dial.""

It was probably 1978 when the opening ""The entire broadcast day of WPIX..."" spiel was added to the script.

And it sounds like the soundtrack of this SSB (U.S. Army Band, natch') came from the following film:
watch?v=7HHTuLrTTh0"
Also . . . it's surprising to see WPIX as a member of the Association of Independent Television Stations.  I see WOR had company by this point . . . 
"(CONT'D) Also . . . what became of the old B&W WPIX TP for them to have used SMPTE ECR 1-1978 color bars with their 400 Hz tone at this point?

But as for the SSB . . . it's EXACTLY as I remember - except by 1979, the film had become as faded as what WCBS used for their own SSB."
"The only question is, who's the announcer on this one?"

"bonsoir mon amie merci beaucoup pour ce beau travail❤Aujourd'hui, dans la nuit du monde et dans l'espérance, j'affirme ma foi dans l'avenir de l'humanité. Je refuse de croire que les circonstances actuelles rendent les hommes incapables de faire une terre meilleure. Je refuse de partager l'avis de ceux qui prétendent l'homme à ce point captif de la nuit que l'aurore de la paix et de la fraternité ne pourra jamais devenir une réalité.  
Je crois que la vérité et l'amour, sans condition, auront le dernier mot effectivement. La vie, même vaincue provisoirement, demeure toujours plus forte que la mort. Je crois fermement qu'il reste l'espoir d'un matin radieux, je crois que la bonté pacifique deviendra un jour la loi. Chaque homme pourra s'asseoir sous son figuier, dans sa vigne, et plus personne n'aura plus de raison d'avoir peur.»tout mon amitié🌹🌹🌹🌹"

They say “Shaq Balloon” as if it’s an actual product that you can pick up at Walmart
That is amazing. How the hell did he do that?
I can't tell if its a balloon or just She Hulk level BAD cgi?

"Lol it wasn’t a Shaq ballon more like a Shaq crane, the secret to this trick is the steel cable wires secretly concealed underneath Shaqs clothing, the crane was hidden from view, and the people in the crowd are paid actors, the reason this trick looks so convincing is the glare from the sun, from the angle he’s being shot at and the sun it’s impossible to see the cable wires. So With enough glare, a Crane, and a paid crowd that’s how it’s done 😆"

Science should leave an answer right here
It is easy to do that... went you sell your soul to the devil
Yeah because i 100% believe that actually happened.
PURE FAKE WHY NOT SHOWING WHEN HE'S  LANDING.
PURE FAKE WHY NOT SHOWING WHEN HE'S  LANDING .

🤦🏻‍♂️ it Doesn’t fucking count when you just use camera tricks and edit shit out and have fake audience reactions!
0:25 Opie just completely dismisses Flavor. Why you gotta do him like that Opster? 😂😂😂😂
It was a leech. That's why he didn't put salt on it.
Holy Shit
"he is getting help from demon spirits, he actually got that man to float with spiritual help"
"of all the explanations, these fools come up with a ""shaq balloon""? lol"
dude. Criss Angel obviously sold his soul to the devil for magical powers
This is a fucking joke. There's a difference between magic and this bullshit.
opie is really funny in this
"I don't think this was a balloon, in fact I really do believe Shaq was flying through the air...



On a rescue board attached to a crane edited out of the video. They just lifted him up and over the house and back down again, simple as that."
You guys don't know shit
This show is retarted
Lmfao a ballon really not wires but a ballon.... really....
"I miss this show so much. Opie, Anthony, Jim and Sam."
not sam 😂
U.F.N.
"I ain't saying shaq can't be a balloon, i'm just saying shaq doesn't cast a shadow when floating"
it's cgi lol he cast no shadow at all
Kaay Jade only for a Scooby snack
funny that shaq' produces no shadow when he is supposedly floating...not on the rooftop and especially clear before he lands.... among every other giveaway.  I'm surprised they aired this its so bad.
is this for real or camera trick???
shaq balloon just makes me laugh
it's CGI Opie lol..
This shit fuckin pisses me off
"It's harder to make a Shaq balloon than it is to actually make Shaq levitate! Knowing how this is done, I can tell you that that is really Shaq up there, honestly."
It's not a shaq balloon dumbasses.
Only american people thinks this is real.
I saw that trick on tv I dont care what anyone says criss angel is epic
Why the fuck are the commentators  hating? This is the most pathetic video I've ever seen... All it is is just you guys hating on Chris angel obviously for no reason other than just cause... I think the videos awesome. And I don't even care weather it's real or not I'm just bored. lol and I wanted to see shaq float...
"With all the editing cuts, you can't know where things get switched out. It's possible Chris used hypnosis on the crowd in-between cuts and there's actually a small crane or wire rigs picking him up. When he goes over the roof it looks like he wiggles on strings. He has a big group, so group psychology is probably at play - that's my guess."
Not magic nlr illusion this is witchcraft magic power of the demons
lol
"God, the show was so great."
There was no shadow
Sly brought meee 
No shadow...
""
Its real
"""Everyone knows it's a Shaq balloon""
""Except Flava Flave"""
"well its shaq and RONDO 
2 very famous basket ball players so it cant be camera trick 
but i cant think its real also lmao"
"Luckky One so let's hear it, is it supernatural? Demonic?..."
"Neither. Just typical methods for a magician's levitation(extremely advanced, obviously). Not telling you the specifics, because ya know, it's a magic trick."
It's Shaq that did it not Chris Angel.
+Pahis Only idiots think magic is anything but 100% illusion.
"Wow an American hater, how fucking hacky is that"
I don't know man.  I met a guy in Greece who thinks Greeks invented pizza and an African man who thinks a one year old baby could cite the entire Koran.  There's stupid people every where dude.
What's wrong with black magic? We are going to die eventually so not like it matters.
Wassat?
Haha Your IQ is low
 @andyboz4752  repent and turn to Christ before its too late...He is the only way to the Father
" @lusagamtc974  Oh please, 100,000 gods worshipped throughout human history, but yours is the right one? Grow up."
 @andyboz4752  they are pagan gods....there are biblical archaelogies that prove the bible is true
 @andyboz4752  you need to repent to Christ broooo before its too late
" @lusagamtc974  Wrong, kiddo. Archaeology has shown time and time again the Bible is false, for example the Israelites were never enslaved by Egypt. Your Christian propaganda books are lying.

At any rate, you're just pretending to know your god is real. The fact is you don't know. Nobody knows. Pretend all you want."
 @andyboz4752  whats your instagram or line??......ill send you some prooofs
 @andyboz4752  whats your religion bro??
" @lusagamtc974  What's the source of your ""proofs?"" If they're anything less than published archaeological journals, I'm not interested. Don't be fooled by pseudoscientific books that claim knowledge or discovery, real archaeology is published in peer reviewed scientific journals. 

I don't have a religion. My beliefs are irrelevant.  My point is taking the Bible as a literal book of history will lead you to error and fantasy."
Lusaga Mtc tel me do you believe in dinosaurs?
No its a Shaq balloon
Valerie Bourjeily  who is Sly?
Yo 😂
"Criss Angel is the lamest of the magicians. He just pays of an audience and asks them to act surprised.

It's SO obvious. Most famous magicians do stuff with real audience. He is so lame.. It's like Wrestling.. Some american idiots actually are amazed and think ""how did he do that in front of an audience?"""
Ant's shaq impression is good isn't there anyone he can't impersonate 
yeaauuhh tumblr - khaydub
"If he hit 'da power lines he woulda been ""shacked""... Chippa"
Criss Angel stinks.
OH GOD!! LOL Sly
My brother in law works as a video editor for that show and a lot of other shit shows but that was green screen all the way.
does it take more or less people than woody wood pecker to operate
i bet the shaq balloon shots better free throws 
"How do balloons come down?...why didn't it just keep floating if it was a ""Shaw Balloon""?"
The ufn comment was the line of the year 
Will the Shaq Balloon be at the Thanksgiving Parade?
Kazaam
shit balloon
"hahaha ""Flav's tricked"""
I did not know Criss Angel was so downed on youtube.  Real surprise to me. I guess everybodys a critic.
If he wanted to do some real magic he should have given that guy his half an arm back.
so which ones the balloon ?
"LMAO, a Shaq balloon. "
that was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jealous haha
"Ki1ngOfGods No, I'm not jealous. I'm being real."
"+Mary Palmens III I'm wealthy, I'm real"

pay ? pay Rondo and shaq ? wtf dude
Who's sly man?

"Este tipo de apresentação , nada tem a ver com o puro e verdadeiro ilusionismo. Uma porção de atores contratados e um ator fazendo o papel de mágico. Quem entende do assunto , sabe o que estou dizendo. Isto é entretenimento televisivo e nada mais!"
I like the this visual commentary.  More please please 
Lol 
"at first i was like yeah right its a shaw ballon, stfu opie, but then i relized, that it probobly was a shaq balloon"
shaq balloon has no shadow hahahaha
that balloon is smarter than the real shaq
Want Shaq Balloon....
Looks more  like the dead Shaq baloon
Someone get that masked magician out of retirement to show us how Shaq Balloon works.
"If it wasn't Shaq Balloon, then what else could it be?
A heavy duty crane, strong invisible ropes, a touch of theatrics, and terrible actors as the participating crowd = levitation of Shaq O'neal "
"Best part of the segment.
""Its a U.F.N"""
"Fucking shaq balloon.
Why wasn't the back of his shirt hanging down some. You can see the shirt is a little baggy yet it doesn't hang down at all.
Always thought Angel was a fucking tool"
am i the only one that noticed shaqs skin changed color with a wave over the face as he layed shaq balloon down?
"no, no, no, it happened i saw it. I was there he flew high in the sky like a bird. Chris Angel is an ingenious god. He touch Shaqs head gingerly like a newborn and he floatited. Over the ROOF!. Most people think because you don't see him land it was fake, that is the most uneventful part. He was folatited. It was amazing. That was the bestest thing I ever seen."
That was amazing! Gave me chills and stuff.
0:50 and again at 4:31 there should be a shadow on the ground but there isn't.
The Shaq balloon belongs to carrot top he used it in last night performance in Vegas 
This is why Criss Angel is an asshole. 
"It's not a balloon, silly Opie.  You're thinking old school real effects.  You can easily green screen Shaq lying down, move the camera around him to match the movement of the shot with just the background and crowd, then overlay the two with the green (or whatever color) fully transparent.  That's basic compositing.  You can also use a fully CG Shaq and backgrounds, but that would be too much of an investment for a quick video.  The crowd is simply acting and this will never be done live because then he wouldn't be able to fake it.  Now if they at least did it all in one continuous shot, they'd have to make it mostly CG, but they used simple cuts to avoid that.  That's 2 practical ways of creating this video and the first one is the one anyone working in VFX would do since it's the cheapest."
Is that fuckin Carrot Top?
fucking yes!!
deuce chills
***** Douche.
smokeordieganja clearly you don't understand what deuce is.  secondly trying to correct someone is in fact douche.
I got it. I was calling you a douche.
right....
all of you. Get off my Internet.
oh wow you are right!!! debunked 
This segment is just so much better with a visual.
No shirt movement no pants movement! Shaq Balloon! Love it!
I WANNA SEE THE SHAQ BALLOON!
as much as i want to believe in Shaq balloon... it looks very green screen
AWESOME!!!  Its even funnier to hear the audio & see the video @ the same time.  Fucking hilarious. 
I've got a balloon over my house!
guys please get me a free xm subscription i need you fuckers back in my life! i still have the radio i just can't justify paying for 10 mins of listening a day! stop feeding e-rock and extra three fucking bagels a day and help a guy out
The hot new Christmas gift this year? SHAQ BALLOON!
i know its fake but is it really a balloon or a dummy?
You couldn't control a balloon like that. Looks like this is simply computer effects. The flare from the Sun can be added with the computer program to make it look like he's floating through the actual Sun glare. 
YEEEAAAHHH!!!!
THERE'S A SHAQ ON MY HOUSE!!!!!!
Check out videOandA
Absolutely horrible.
How underwhelmed must Shaq have been after asking for years to be levitated that they flew a Shaq Balloon overhead while he had to hide behind a shrub?
"chipper got it right, its obviously shaq and hes obviously floating. "
Can't wait for the video element in the future podcast version of O&A. This was easily 10x funnier with the visual
"After all is said and done, who got to keep the Shaq balloon?"
"i will bet money that there's absolutely no evidence of Shaq EVER even once calling Criss Anal in the press about levitating him, EVER. 

not a single time. ever. "
"Opie have you seen the VideOandA channel it's just like this it's awesome, check out when you guys watched the guy climbing the giant radio pole fucking thing hilarious"

I'm a time traveler....I think I'm a little late but I have some bad news.
Criss Angel gave your video a thumbs down.
"1:18 - 1:26 Watch Flava Flave try to play his part by telling Criss that he is ""the man""...... and Criss ignores Flave.... then Flave is butthurt."
Visual element f*** yeah!
"The phrase ""shaq balloon "" has me fucking dying lol"
"Shaq'so acting is priceless 
Love how he looks back in the sky  to try to solidify the trick"

Chris Angle = Douche Bag
Eric Howell who's Chris Angle?
***** Kurt's brother.
He's Criss Angel's obtuse cousin.  
"Op, I really like the video/show audio stuff you're putting up. Keep it going!"
"I'm two minutes in, still waiting for an Erock is fat joke."

"“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.” 
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
"Приятно смотреть и слушать прославление Господа Бога детьми Израиля , которые воспитаны с молоком матери любить , поклоняться и славить Бога Отца . Да благословит Бог Отец во имя Сына Божия Иисуса Христа , познать Истину и принять Его , Иисуса Христа в своё сердце , поверить , что Он Есть Истинный Мессия Спаситель Мира и Искупитель Всемогущий всего человечества от греха  и заблуждения . Господь сними с народа Твоего покрывало , чтобы народ Твой избранный Израиль, поклонился Тебе , Триединому Богу Творцу и Создателю во имя Иисуса Христа, Которого Ты послал на землю пострадать и спасти всех живущих , отдать Свою жизнь и пролить Свою Святую Кровь , которая очищает и омывает от всякого греха . Храни всех верующих в Тебя от искушений и соблазнов этого мира , даруй мудрости и сил оставаться твёрдыми и крепкими в Вере"

3:24  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
3:25  Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
3:26  To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."

"Luke 24:44  And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
Luke 24:45  Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
Luke 24:46  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
Luke 24:47  And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
Luke 24:48  And ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke 24:49  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."

"Hello Jude, thank you for your reflection, yes you was understand right. ;-) Yaakov Shwekey is for me one of the best singers in this world. So pure the  voice; going straith to the heart and the feelings he have when he is singing! Just wunderful. Nice greetings to New York! ;-)"
..and i was mean that the boy who sings by 1:50 is like a Yaakov Shwekey Junior Talent - I was like his part much! - A wonderful talent !
GBolingo thanks for responding I appreciate it! you sound like a very Soulful person - that's great! I'm actually going to listen to this again right now! one of the best songs I've ever heard in my entire life!
"Its  wonderful from your side, Jude. You feel the same wonderful vibes. So i am not alone. Smile ;-) This is  nice. I am thankful for this nice music and voices between others all over the world. And i like to say it when its a gift to even find it one day. And i am so thankful."

wow Yiddish Nachas with Mendy Hershkowitz what a set
what I like the most is that he gave solo's to alot of his talented boys not just one of them

"Utterly stunning. A true masterpiece of automotive art with an engine that roars like a lion.
Bravo Pagani!"
"Not that this would probably ever happen and God forbid it did, but what would happen if this car got in an accident and landed on its roof? How would an occupant get out of the car with these doors?"
feels like I'm the only one that thinks this is ugly
That ambient lighting variation was a surprise — the bluetooth keyboard I’m typing on right now has that and in the same colors.
Smoking in a car like this would be a crime and insult.
"“The key looks like a Pagani Huayra driving down the road…” Well, at least the ass end of it!"
FML this is one ugly car but taste has no friends they say
"The thing about not hiding the AMG/MB Logo I think it is related on how the relationship between Horacio and AMG was born.

When he started the design of the Zonda (back in the early 90's), Juan Manuel Fangio wrote a recomendation/request letter to Mercedes Benz about the engines for Horacio's first hyper car. Fangio was an ambassador for the brand due to the racing times in F1. I think for that consideration MB had with Horacio thanks to Juan Manuel's recommendation/request letter, that Pagani is kinda ""proud"" of being powered by AMG."
this is what i picture when i think of a super car
For $3 million this car is a big robbery there should 14k gold pieces all up and through in the car.
damn the interior is ugly as shit 😭
Aí fala memino.
No other car makes you go WOW! like a Pagani does. The interior in this one is pure poetry
2m3 được k ạ.😅.
Of all the cars I've seen videos or read reviews of I have never in my life heard or read negatives or criticism of any Pagani ever made. They are simply perfection.
Respect for the Artist and his passion
"I always wondered about these Pagani. I do believe Pagani makes 100% of the car, no outsourcing (and why the price tag). Really cool you got to drive it, never have seen one even driven before. Really cool car, Pagani's eye for detail is incredible."
"Ugly compared to Zonda.

That is a dreadful spec too. Red with red accents and beige interior? Awful."
The only beautiful thing in the interior are the seats the rest is garbage
Wow your knowledge and presentation is out of this world 🌎 👏
"Cars like that usually have an emergency hammer so the occupant can bust the window. That, or it had a special exemption for being a low production vehicle"
the hand brake looks like a pene
"Wyuira?
Wtf?
It's Pagani Huayra, not Wyuira."
"Pag's are over rated, I know, I have raced them."
I'd name my Huayra Pablo
The gearbox
"This car or any of their cars are not worth this price.

You can get a car that does the same things, has the same materials and costs a fraction of that price. It's just a way for Pagani like many other manufacturers, extort money from gullible rich folk. Even if I was LOADED, I wouldn't fork out these kinds of prices..."
the key is fucking hideous hahahaha
This interior is my all time fav
Not a fan of the style.
"""Like bumblebee, but better in every way"""
2023 here and this Pagani Huayra is still so damn legendary.
I am sorry but I give it all a 10 out 10
I owe an apology to Pagani I wasn't familiar with his game
You know the car's gotta be good when there is a 3 minute section about the key
"That key is one of the lamest things I have ever seen. I'd get the cut key copied and open the car manually with that, instead of being seen with this horrendous key."
"Me: Sees a Pagani Huayra
Also me: plays Love Songs Drug Songs by X Ambassadors in the background"
"38:30 “I could never pay this much for a car”

Way to prove yourself wrong Doug. You made it."
New planes must not have switches
What a stupid review
Dials don't mean they aren't gauges dumbass
In what ways is the price not justified?
bro is punchin the air
 @lifelong1753  he's missing too lmao
"6:18 No it isn't, they just ordered a bunch of bolts with a logo on it. Wow so impressed"
"Signed by Jloouin Pojoien. $3 million and only 100 produced, the asshole doesn't bother signing the thing properly."
"I finally got an ""invitation"" for this car in Gran Turismo 7 and I picked the same the color before ever watching this Doug review. Funny coincidence for me."
"Another nice one Doug!

...I drive semi trucks for a living and...I absolutely LOVE your job!

Keep up the good work bro!

🙋🏽‍♂️"
ART ON WHEELS.
Just park it in your living room and call it a day.
this design is why aliens keep us alive
Хорошую вещь Пагани Хуярой не назовут =)
19:24 just in case you want to risk burning your 3 million dollar leather
I dead-ass thought that hole in the seat was an air vent to chill my balls
It's a really cool car but priced versus worth is the operative term
Are the Hookers Included?
How does YouTube know I’m playing GTA 5 and was wondering what care it looked like.
Pagani is the Richard Mille of car's universe
Am i the unique who sees this car ugly?
the only thing i dont like about this car is the fact that i cant have it.
Best interior super car IMO!
Think he'd do a vid with a Vibe?
Amg? Wow
Holy Shit I'm amazed
Y u so hater
6:15 - Looks like shit.
"""All tightened ever so perfectly""



**cracks carbon fiber 6:10 that's a pretty big and expensive  mistake"
Pagani interiors are hideous and convoluted.
"one day I’ll own this bad boy…




…in Gran Turismo 7"
Only time I can ever drive this car is in need for speed😭 it sucks in those games!
this pagani is the best thing i ever driven
A pagani owner is so poor he has to hire a YouTuber to promote a car he’s trying to sell
"The interior of this car is just too much. To the point of it being gawdy.  The exterior styling is awesome, but the interior isn't for me."
"Disgusting excess and greed... ahh, progress."
"one of the most beautiful and wonderful cars I've ever seen; was one of my favorites ever since it's release...
so cool to see it on here, as I'll probably never have the chance to 'explore' it myself (probably for the better)"
how'd he miss that the brake pedal is shaped and formed to look like the brake light?
"Amazing car, but the font for the knobs and switches is awful"

This car is just a one big piece of jewellery! Absolutely beautiful and timeless!
because you need blinkers and wipers on the race track lol
no its not. unless 3 million $ don't mean anything to you. i'll take my words back if the resale value us > 3 mil $
I do like his custom stitching. What a nice touch
This car is immaculate beauty! A shame that toy car «key» is the stupidest and tackiest thing ever. I would be embarassed to show it to people!
This car is well worth $3 million.
Bro how does it not get 10/10 for styling
It’s really really really freakin beautiful
Doug is the type of guy to order chicken tenders at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.
I get a sort of art deco/steam punk feeling. Absolutely phenomenal automobile and a great review from Doug.  Would be better if he were wearing a tuxedo from the 1930's.
"Absolutely beautiful car, but not worth $3,000,000."
"Pentru masinile astea care nu au portbagaje si nu sunt PRACTICE ,uite o solutie pentru cineva care calatoreste singur si are spatiu suficient in partea pasagerului!"
15:36 The brake pedal is shaped as the tail lights
I'm here because some delusional chick on Courtney Ryans youtube channel introduced me to this car lol
No car is worth 3m
Learn some engineering and bodywork skills then push the cost down by 90%
""" does it come with a pagani leather wallet!"""
Looks nice but it is a useless price...I drive for speed on a circuit or to get somewhere. Having a work of art on wheels in the city to flex and feel like you are in a fancy box on wheels is a waste if you ask me. Would rather take a mustang .
"Car is an absolute masterpiece. In my top 3, along with the Jaguar XJ220 and McLaren F1."
nice car but owner needs to take some driven lessons look at the back end someone backed into something lol
Lol I saw this exact car a few days ago in Houston
pagani huora 🤣🤣🤣
y-raw
The brake pedal is a nod to the key that came with the zonda
"After all these years and you're STILL saying 'film' where you should be saying 'shoot' or 'video'. 
You're lazy and uncaring. Not cool. 
Get cool."
The attention to detail on that car is unbelievable absolute dream machine ❤👌👌
Cuando lo vi por dentro dije k es la caga más grande  del planeta a salomon
"Yes, it is worth 3 million. I know that, because people have paid 3 million for it. 
The value of anything is how much people will consistently pay for it. 
I believe he sold all of the ones he made."
" @zenlandzipline  agree to disagree, because it is subjective."
" @dallassaelee4507  it is subjective. You are correct. 
It isn’t worth 3 million to you. But to other people, it is. 
I think a lot of that has to do with your bank account, too. Lol
If I was worth 10 million dollars, I would not buy that car. 
If I was worth 500 million dollars, I would probably buy that car. 
But because I am only worth about $1, I just drive my Jeep.  :)"
the car worth 3 million simply because everyone on the market agreed.
Market forces
Ese carro fue el primer super car k me gustose lo vi  al mario de Alicia y para encontrarlo fue casi imposible sin saber el nombre

You know Horacio Pagani is a design and engineer nerd when he enables you to literally turn your car into 'exploded view' to make the car its own visual analytical diagram but also  just to show  it off.
Worth $3 million to whom?
"The gage cluster is the coolest, most well designed interior in my opinion. Looks like artwork."
That’s not a hole in the seat it’s an oval
"That's not ""chromatherapy"", that's the GAMING mode!"
"So... the turn signals are on the wheel so that they are more accessible when you are on the racetrack? Also, I'll say it because nobody else will: Oversized keys shaped like cars are tacky.
P.S. Nothing against the Pagani Huayra. Looks amazing."
"The seat adjustment is for your balls, prevention of sweaty balls."
Stupid cheap key
"I would love a wagon with this eye to detail. But a car that does not haul any materials is not something I would spend money on, regardless how much I have."
I'll trade my 2018 Golf for this easy.
it is my dream to someday own one
Sonos Faber speakers?! Holy shit! The sound system in that car costs more than most peoples mid sized luxury SUVs! My god!
"Yes, McLaren F1 is the best car ever built."
The hole in Back of seat is also a logo shaped oval like other places.
Pagani Huayra '13
"Man, this guy talks to much. Very inefficient car review, more than half of the video is just watching him talking ( just talking without showing the thing he is talking about) SHOW FEATURES AND TALK ALONG. SAVE OUR TIME."
Horacio Pagani is a very famous guy no doubt.
"wait... did you just say ""so you can look down on your paganni key while driving your paganni and that's super cool"" ?:::... no it's not, i'ts f*** dangrous doug!"
I’d love to just receive all the luggage as a gift! Hint Hint … Horacio Pagani 💕
A 7 out of 10 on quality. Really😐
I have been trying if I could just Luke this car but I couldn't come to terms of me liking it. 🤔
"I am happy to say that I own a Pagani Huayra myself 




















In FH4."
California roads would put dents in this car.
"ive rewatched the driving part of this video atleast 20 times and its always impressive, i live in love with this car"
im surprised doug didnt mentioned the mercedes part number on the engine
The most beautiful car in the world
Sitting in a 1 Mio car in Walmart shorts 🩳 .. classic Doug 😂
"I don’t see it at that price. Koenigsegg does everything better for the same price. I suppose you can just buy both, but they seem levels apart. I disagree with the practicality score. This has more storage and practicality than almost all of not all 7 figure hypercars."
Sqiudward aproves the climate controls
"Un verdadero orgullo. Horario Pagani. Argentino . Como el tango, el mate y el dulce de leche. Aclaro esto por qué mucha gente pensará que es italiano. Pero no"
Quality  7/10 ? ? ? Are you mad sir ?
Is the Bugatti why walks more special than the McLaren speed tail
"Pretentiousness and impracticable car.
Actually it's ugly too."
36:21 Doug Demura as a speed meth head in the middle of taking a hit.
I actually DON'T LIKE IT. WOW
"This is 4 wheel opulence , and yes I’m jealous"
this has the single most stunning interior to any car ever made
The Huayra interior is very steampunk 😄
I wonder how often you have to replace those super expensive splitters?
Pagani is currently my favorite car brand 🇮🇹
osiris
This might very well be my most favorite car.. Even in 2022
Looks like a snow plough.
this car looks like a second skin
"God, the inside is so beautiful ;_;"
Is it really that much better than a Corvette? Or a Tesla that does 0-60 in 2.5?  Not for the price. Maybe very cool. But for the price? IMO.
i came here when strad watched this video on how to charge the battery in a trailer i tink
ugly
"Hot take, I really don't like the interior. It just seems really busy. The Gauge Cluster font is reminiscent of shit 90s websites. And this might just be because of filming, but the entire area has so much shine to it, I can't help but feel like I'm staring at nothing but glare."
Count how many times he says the word ‘Cool’… it’s very annoying.
Timeless piece of art
I'm sorry but... That key is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. Who in their right mind wants to carry that giant thing around? It will be right next to my overstuffed velcro wallet with 20 credit cards and 200 receipts
Excelente!!! Pagani es el mejor y mas audaz de los diseñadores de la historia automovilística . Saludos desde Mar del Plata Argentina
"Interior looks like a cappuccino machine, in a good way."
Our Italian teachers surname was Pagano....I hope he is driving a Pagani😂🤣😂🤣
"this car is gorgeous jesus. the more i look at it the crazier and more beautiful it looks. everything part of the car is art. the gauges, the speakers, the lights and launch control. more of a piece of art than a track car"
Love the enthusiasm about the key 😂😂 I love this car and this yt channel
"That key is cheesy and should be made of platinum for a 3 million dollar car. But that gage cluster, interior, & exterior muah..."
I didn't even realize it was 40 minutes 😂🤣
"Very funny an american if wondering and joking about the advice in the manuals about not locking someone in the car, after his fellow americans sueing companies because of missing information that coffee can be hot. There are stupid people out there, but no one beats the stupidity of the american nation (proof: election of their second to last president)..."
"Can we see more car, not your clown face"
Holy crap anyone else notice the max speed attained by that car was 172 mph?
I want one.
"It’s not “worth” 3 mill $ ,dumbass😂"
only reason i would buy a supercar is because it was dirt cheap and resale would be nuts.
Hopefully I own one in 5-6 years from now
"Coolest car,ugliest paint job."
Interior looks like as if the West Coast Customs guys did that for a TV show.
"You should,  really,  should have,  FLOORED THE HELL OUT OF IT!!!!!    FLOORED IT!!!!!!!!!!  Slap-ass-to the floor and held it there for at least,  20 SECONDS!!!!!!"
I’m at 36:00 and Doug is getting down on the gas-pedal.  He’s seeing / feeling just how addicting it is. To be able to go soooooooo FAST!!!!
"Yeah when I compare this to the newly revealed Utopia, it just makes the Utopia look like a tacky over-designed kit. What do I know though, I probably can't even afford a single screw on either car"
My grandmother's name was Huayra...How's that for 3 mil..)
If I won the lottery. This is what I would be driving.
Doug gives a score before he goes to sleep.
I'd sooner saddle & adjust the stirrups on my own polo pony than ever let anyone at the Country Club see me using an old fashioned car key to start my car.
"Re: Price/affordability, anyone who can afford this isn't worried about money... AT ALL. As 99.9% of the Earth's population cannot afford this, this shouldn't ever be considered. The only folks I can think of that would care about these categories are dealers/ flippers, who don't care about (or it just doesn't apply to them) all the other categories. As only dealer's would apply to the financial scores, the fact that these cars are constantly appreciating would give it a Doug Score of 10/10. Just saying 🙂"
"Did Lewis Hamilton really sell his personalized Pagani because it was the ""Worst handling"" car he owns? Or did he say that tongue in cheek? (I'm an easily confused geezer, fyi)"
"Get the fuck off then, there’s enough videos of this car that doesn’t contain any explanations."
"considering it wont depreciate, yes it is worth 3 million"
"By far my dream car. Giant reliable Mercedes V12 (with singing turbos!!), Undeniably beautiful design, active aero and a gorgeous, artful interior. Sheer vehicular ART. 🐐"
Am I the only one who doesn’t care about this car and only likes the zonda
PAGANI PROBABLY IS A PERFECTIONIST WITH OCD TENDENCY
13:20 Am I the only one who cringed at the fact he pulled the handbrake up without pressing the button first causing that weird cracking noise 🥴🥴🥴
osiris from gta 5
tempo means time
tempesta means storms by the way for y'all illiterate niggas tempesta edition
Sounds like an airplane taking off ⚡️
I have been very impressed by this car. I watched every minute of the review
"Huayra was the first hypercar that I know every details of, and will be my most favorite, period. Too bad I have never seen it in real life."
Imagine buying one of this on someone opens the fuel cap which doesn't lock and puts sugar in it.
"זה לא שווה את המחיר ..
צריך להוריד לפחות ב 1 מיליון .."

"The blueing of the exhaust can only come from the car running at pace for some time. If this was a garage queen and not tracked, at least some, the exhaust wouldn't have that amount of blueing, if any at all."
"Folks think very expensive cars like this have ash trays for European smokers. Not at all. It's because the VAST majority of hypercar owners are known to like a great cigar with their leisure drives in their hypercars.  When I ordered my last car from a different manufacturer but in the same class, I asked about the ashtray option and I was told, ""most of our clients have three things in common. A love for cars, a love for wine, and a love for great cigars. Since they can't drink wine while driving, they choose to smoke their cigars while enjoying a drive."
6:17    the carbonfiber around the titaniumscrew looks not so perfekt /broken 🤔🤐😱😅
"Sorry but that whole ""key"" thing is beyond what I would expect of this car. Lost me quick."
Why buy a 3mil car with an airplane aesthetic when you can buy an airplane for way less? lol
Perfect*🙄
Non car people just don’t get it.
As long as the US has speed limits this car is a pretty Albatross.
"If I had the money I would by one, but I would ask them to change the spelling. It would be much more interesting to own a Pagani Huarya maybe add a dash and then if I saw someone looking at my car, I could say, ""That's MY Pagani, Hu-arya?!"" :elbowcough:"
This is my new favourite car in the world .it is absolutely beautiful 🤩
the fonts used in the interior design look like power point.
"It , Go Hard 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯"
too much clutter
"I have been  watching a lot of your videos and gaining insperation from what you do; and belive it should be continued; Like a saga. Must say.. this car, is amaazing! By far my most favorited vehicle of all time. If you live in Fredericton NewBrunswick, and have a cool car, please!.... Let me review it!"
Calling it chromatherapy instead of achromatherapy was a huge under sight
36:21 Doug stops talking for 14 seconds
The squarish back end kinda makes me think about Vector W8
How much for the oil change?
36:00  sirens? XD
I feel like Horacio Pagani is one of the few hypercar makers that truly understands how to make a car timeless.
The Pagani ‘oval’ is not an oval at all but an Ellipse🙂. Great video. Loved it. 😁
Oval is not a cool shape tho
"Zonda was perfection, this got ugly tail lights"
"Every car's lover must know that PAGANI is actually the real ITALIAN HAND MADE product...expecially for the Body of the car...also if there is an argentinian owner, Horacio was born in Argentina, and also with a german engine AMG Mercedes...
Hand made and less weight...for me is better and lighter than Bugatti or Koenisegg."
this is what a stock car race car should look like.
In Italy having a loud horn is essential...to make to slow looser in front of u to move away ...of course the honk would be accompanied by some italian swearing 🤣
"No doubt this vehicle will go down in history as one of the most beautiful cars ever made.     I could see a coach builder 100 years in the future looking at this vehicle as going ""I want to build a modern day interpretation of this"".   Of course the car will probably fly (literally) by that time,  who knows.     The attention to detail is unparallel in vehicle design.    The only car that I can think of that even comes close to this one is a Koenigsegg.      You can definitely tell that Horacio Pagani is an artist as well as a vehicle engineer.    Similar to how Ettore Bugatti was from an artistic family also and that clearly showed in the way he designed his cars.    Form and function blend together."
And Christian von Koenigsegg
​ @EzioAuditore-tv3vv  Koenigsegg are far from timeless. Cool looking for their time. Look at the first Koenigsegg and the first Zonda.
That steering wheel reminds me of a certain la ferrari
That gauge cluster is insane
lack of sinematic shots 💢
mirrors looks like a leaf
Imagine paying 3m for that lol
Very cool Pagani Huayra
"Just gonna say, the hand brake is very phallic looking."
In my opinion the most beautiful car in the world . The interior is art work .
The best interior car in history. Its a leonardo da vinci.
"The only thing about this car, that I would change, are the mirrors... they look like Dr. Suess made them"
Imagine your girl keys ur pagani.... you’ll never see here agani
"Slow in 2022 standards lol 
Less power the a family car now"
Imagine your kid playing with his cars and then you realized one of them is your car key-
"So why the signature of who built the engine? Are these engines literally put together by hand by basically just one master mechanic or something? I thought for sure it would take more than one person to put a engine like that together, but I don tknow much about cars so..."
Jesus... it literally has flaps... Thats really cool
"Gosh I love your videos so much... I accidently come across them every so often, I dont think its the cars that pull me in though, its your love and zest for car knowledge and 'quirks and features'. Its just fun watching you talk about it!"
I really didn’t expect a cigarette lighter in a Pagani😨
Still one of the coolest interiors ever buildt
It's just wow. I've never seen such luxury sport car ever
The hole in the seat is another pagani oval.  The madmen.
"It's insanely beautiful!, and truly looks in motion standing still."
probabl the worst key ever made
"This car interior like that of a spaceship from some anime movie.
And it is really very fancy and very cool too."
dug score
Did anyone count the number of times he said 'cool'
HEY Doug! Why don't you ever wear your t-shirts?
Mehehe
"Here's what you all came for.
Pagani Huayra Horn: 10:23"
Holy F that exhaust sounds like an actual angry animal
Pagani is the Frank Lloyd Wright of Automotive design.
6:20 bro what? that looks jank as fuck wtf is up with all those scrapes around the bolt
very nice car👌👌👌❤
"WHAT KIND OF ENGINE,  OUTDATED FOR PRICE. NO ELECTRONICS FOR 3M  OVERPRICED"
2022 bMW M5 CS has entered the chat:
Mind boggling features & perfection in every small part of this super car.....Means pagani stolen my heart ❤️🔥🔥🙌
"Pagani: When you want an exotic, but you still want utility.
Seriously, Pagani designed the Zonda and Huayra with a crazy amount of storage for a 2 seater exotic supercar. It's ingenious design!"
No car worth 3 million! Oh and those fancy little bolts with the logo that are so perfectly tightened had a crack around it!
"If you can't have two; one for a daily driver and one for weekends.  Then you are not rich enough and too materialistic. The key is ....... dumb. Awful damn silly. If you can't park in a lot like like the rest of us, you are just not as calm as we.  Also the car is a plural of a Pagan, what?"
A what?
It's mid
"yeah, i would lose this key lmao"
Love the interiors of these cars so much. Just WOW
Who wants that bulky key fob in their pockets
Driving scene is the epic one when listening to headphones 🎧
Btw the car has been driven hypothetically for not more than 5 days
Beautiful
This piece of art is the absolute perfect combination of classy and flashy
Что за красотка😍🔥
This car is unnecessarily retarded
I want a tour of the house!
Rolls Royce got luxury british heritage while Pagani got luxury Italian heritage 🥰
Dude 2! Huke 1!
The vehicle is in gta v  as grotti
This car is extremely well put together and all that but that tacky font they've used to label all the interior stuff looks like it should be on the box of a cheap Chinese piece of electronics and it cheapens the look of the interior of the car imho.
Because some idiots have more money than sense?
Quality car
"3 million dollars car = pagani 

3 dollars outfit  = Doug"
Do you do turn signs on race track? 🤔
9:27 And when will you use blinkers on a race track?
The brake pedal is the same design as the brake lights!
"When multiple classes are racing at the same time, yes turn signals and hazards are used so that the slower cars can let the faster cars pass them without an issue. Most track days will have all kinds of types of cars driving at the same time so it's an unwritten rule that if you know you're the slower car you signal and move over so the faster car can pass safely"
When you're driving multiple class track day. You use blinkers to either let a faster car safely pass you or so you safely pass a slower car. Watch Nurburgring footage where they let all classes on the track and you'll see how often turn signals and/or hazard lights are used when a faster car approaches a slower car
$3 million dollars for an art piece for the road.
Who give a shit about that f...... car
So you need to open up the engine bay to access your luggage?  Seems convenient...
Interor is so nice!
Thanks Doug  I’m dreaming
I love EVERYTHING except the the stupid looking side mirrors.  I think they absolutely ruin the perfect aesthetic of the car.
"Here's one thing that Doug did end up mixing up. The Huayra isn't actually a supercar, but rather a hypercar. He mentioned supercar when talking about the extra compartment for vehicle registration, etc."
I like how calm you sound in these older videos.
2014 and that car looks like it will be coming out in 2023.  That interior is absolutely breathtaking.  This car is seriously timeless!
The vents in the front totally look like a grumpy frog.
"Ergonomic and design excellence, truly timeless hence a good investment"
"I have 2 of these, in gta v"
The fact owner let Doug drive this marvelous car is so cool
This is a work of art.
33:14 - G-Wagon spotted.
Hands down the most beautiful interior by far.
The interior is very beautiful
"150 000  Titanium Pagani Printed Bolts be damned , it  still Rattles  when you close the door , from what i hear , rattles like a bitch . It is a beautiful  car  no doubt , but it  only has  100h only , imagine how much it would rattle  after 400 000h like my Skoda Superb , and 4 out of 5 doors on that do not Rattle , only Driver door Rattles but there is something wrong with it , when i drive i feel it vibrate like something is not bolted correctly . rest of the doors don't rattle , and that is after 200 000 miles , and its not a joke car , it still has 250bhp and goes 0-100kmh in 6.5s , that is not a slow car .  It actually the car i like the most . I mean driving Pagani is fine and all , but Jesus Christ someone is going to kill you in that , people kill for lot less then Million dollars . While im safe in my 10 000$ car or whatever . Safety first  right . And that is why it has 100h only i would guess ,  you cant drive that  and feel safe i guess , no matter how rich you are ."
"Beautiful car, ugly body color, uglier wheel color."
"I don’t see any of that crappy cheap looking alcantera.  Mark my word, in 20 years, there will be a bunch of super cars whose alcantera interiors have started to deteriorate and look horrific."
the one who comments
Italian cars are best
Can anyone explain why u don’t see the dislikes ? Nor does anyone say anything negative …ever .
That’s a stupidest key I would ever want 2 pieces
"Cool car. But I have to say, IMHO, the key is the cheesiest thing. Looks like something you would get in a Hasbro toy kit."
I would drive this car everyday if I had one
Thank you very much Doug
That key is incredibly goofy
"One info missing about this car is that the leather inside it, is made to be soft as woman's hands."
My favourite car in the world.
"""And i was like yaahh,"" Ahahahhhahahahahaha"
It is very busy and overcome design. Not worth 3 million
"if I had two million euros, I would buy a McLaren P1 GTR or a Koenigsegg"
"35:54 Doug just saw God, and he was Italian"
that is probably the biggest key-fob I've ever seen...how much does that thing weigh..?
"It’s funny that Doug gets to drive the car alone, but Jay Leno has to serve as a passenger while   Mr PAGANI does the driving."
It gets 9/10 for styling! Is there any car that gets a 10?
Who wishes and thought the knob in the seat was a crotch cooler aka the ac vent
The mother ship life boat the mother ship being the egg these two cars I want in my drive way

Beautiful car with an iconic rearend. Baby Got Back!

Yeah now that's what Jerome Robinson would consider to be a car bay bay. I'd love to ride around South Beach in a Caliente wip like that FO SHO  !!!! ( An electrifying comment from mee !!! exclusivlee !!!! Bay Bee !!!!! )
What a truly beautiful car. That interior is a work of art.

"She never decided to go to rehab,  she was forced to go by the police. Under the same situation someone trying to hurt themselves would be sent to hospital."
It seems like it 😂
Yeah I know. That’s why she’s relapsing. Cause she never wanted help to begin with.
"Zio!!
Za worldo"
This really buttered that guys biscuits  smh
This really butters my biscuts
Yes the world is a weeb
Great gameplay you 1st time play this game ??
"I want to see some extreme levels, maybe turn it into a series"
Nice video!
No I have played it twice before on the channel there's a play list if you'd like to watch it
Okay then ill work toward them haha should be a fun rage series haha
Thank you so much!
She’s the only person that can get away with saying the n word
I want to whistle like you
That... is so sexy
Whistle sounds like a doorbell
My Cocks on Fire
"Have you ever tried smoking weed? Not sure if it would help, but it has been known to help with epilepsy which happens to be an involuntary reaction. Maybe it could help with tourettes too. Couldn't hurt to try."
"How does Tourettes work? 

Can you feel it coming"
"Not only are you a wonderful person, but you whistle beautifully...Love your content..."
She had dirty thoughts 🤣
Bitch lasagna!!!!
"Anita, hi, I'm sure you wont see this but you have been my inspiration for a few years now and it really means a lot to me that you are as successful you are. Please keep being you.

You are doing great and I love how far you have come. Please keep being you and doing so well"
"2:20 ""it's embarrassing for everyone"" But it's worse for the Shitter, especially women, they're so self conscious about that, guys don't care about the noises they make."
0:38
"Omfg, that whistling is like 1930s skills!!  Simply amazing"
"her whistling sounds like music from the 1950s, just lovely"
You are attractive and funny!
Well my dicks on fire 😂
"She’s fake guys, she’s done this routine for years pretending to have Tourette’s but she doesn’t want to compete with attractive women so she hangs out with uglies to control the social dynamic with her “tics.” Smart, but she’s a typical fake female."
Cringe comment aha
She’s diagnosed. Do some research.
 @1murdaloca  no she's not
 @RasPeete  She is. You’re clearly uneducated and believe random strangers claiming to know her. Come back when you know anything about tics.
"She doesn't want to compete with attractive women? Bro, wtf are you taking about lol she is already attractive, plus no one thinks about competition when making friends (unless you're a weirdo)"
For the n word section it took me a minute to realize that wasn’t a tik on its own
i want to join her clan. i don’t give a crap what game she is playing.
Shawty got demons not Tourettes
"Anita, you know you’ve seen a person and said, maybe to yourself, “hi! I like your face. Can I see you naked?” 
Don’t ask me how many times I’ve thought that(but didn’t say it because I’m a gentleman)."
I love how the chatters are so used to her tics they barely comment on them and mostly comment on what she's trying to say instead.
"about a minute in

was that a tweet or was that her...lol"
0:18 bitch lasagna
"The whistling of that song was amazing I don’t know why but I thought, she could probably hit a dope somewhere over the rainbow"
i feel so sad just looking at this
Know your dick and fucking make it thick😂
The fact that people still believes she has tourettes is a proof that most people cant think for themselves.
“my c*cks on fire” is her best one
"I’m sorry, but @4:30 is the best one"
Dis bitch obviously faking and taking the piss out of everyone 😂some Southpark shit
This is why I didn’t get jabbed. Peter 3:15 repent now
"Serious question, if she grew up her whole life not knowing any swear words, what would she be yelling out?"
Dont watch while high.
Why do I have a feeling she's faking Tourettes?
Bitch Lasagna
The ending is absolutely hilarious
She’s diagnosed
" @1murdaloca  by who, her online friends?"
" @RasPeete  No, professionals. Do some research before assuming"
"They clearly diagnosed her for ""attention seeking"" and some years later she forced it by threatening the doctors. Do your own research"
" @RasPeete  Also, you can’t force a doctor to do anything. Tics can be caused by a lot of things, and the doctors didn’t believe her for years. She’s diagnosed with it now and literally proved it’s real."
" @1murdaloca  yeeah... From people she grew up with and even worked with clearly says she used her ""condition"" as an excuse when she didn't want to pay attention in class and so on. In school she was known to be a manipulating spoiled kid who screamed at people until she got her way, always came up with stories to get attention. Your research is based on entertainment sites."
" @1murdaloca  lol. Ofc you can. Try go to different doctors until one out of many gives you what you want. If 6-7 doctors says you're not having a condition you say you have, you probably don't have it"
 @RasPeete  I bet those people don’t even know her. People could easily lie and say they grew up with Beyoncé. My research is based on PROFESSIONAL research and confirmed education. What’s yours? Random people in the comments claiming to know her?
" @RasPeete  I’ve been in her situation. A lot of doctors are dismissive and blame symptoms on anxiety when it’s clearly more than that. It took me over 2 years to get diagnosed with conditions that i KNEW i had (i did the proper research), but doctors and my family said it was my anxiety. im now diagnosed with TS and more."
" @1murdaloca   @1murdaloca   @1murdaloca  I bet they do, and it's not from yt comments or whatever. So you have research her life and her condition from her medical reports and experience from people around her? Your ""professional"" research is probably internet searches about tourettes syndrome overall, but not hers in person. So you have some sort of education on the topic and not just some thing you ""feel"", you said your research was based on professional research and education. You don't have a profession just because you have a  certain condition, just so you know. 
And as I said, you can force it just you did: doctors and your family said you didn't have a condition but you somehow got it on paper, probably by changing doctors and demanding them to write down a condition based on your feelings. 
The people I have discussed with DID actually know her from school and some of them lived in the same neighborhood as her.
I do know people lie, but just because the President says the gov have no interest in a proxy war doesn't mean they don't. The most manipulative people are the most convincing, just like Anita.  I'm not here to argue with someone who ""feels"" something about something. Feelings isn't facts and will never be. 
Look at society today - the most disturbing, lying,  people are the ones that argues that feelings are considered facts, demanding people to accept their psychosis and so on."
" @1murdaloca  why is it that the tourets words are always fock bitch cunt dick and terribly funny words...she might be embellishing it to make herself more entertaining..
Love her, she's adorable"
Anita's whistling cover of the Troll song was strangely calming as hell
Where were you all my life? 😂
"She's very cool, and very sweet, and I wish her all the best for her future."
Bitch lasagna lol
You're pretty damn fantastic at whistling. Wish I could do that.
“I CAN HEAR YOU SHITTING” That's how you stablish dominance
Bro f the tics Why tfs her whistling that good tho
TOUCH MY CUNT AND FIST MY KITTEN
haha shes awesome (in a good way)
Last one got me lol I will touch your cunt I will fuck your mates
Some of these tics are cute lol
Sometimes she’s aware of her tick and other times it’s like she blacked out and forgot it like it never happened
😭😭😭😭🤣😂😂🤣🤣
And now she’s on insta lol
"pesquisem "" dileira "" e veja o nível da touret  desse streaming brasileiro   kkkkkkkkkkk"
Your so fake I am going to light into you like a firework on the fourth of July.
The tics always come out nowhere they suprise me so much
I love this girl so much. Not in a creepy way i just genuinely have a soft spot for her.
bitch lasagna
"i wish my tourettes were that calm, when i game i look up and down in game and irl, creates distractions!"
Quite the wordsmith lol
That is the whitest mixed girl I’ve ever seen
Idk but I think she spends to much time on Twitter
"“Ope, we got a bit of lag again”

Literally how Tourettes works. Except you aren’t lagging, you are just short circuiting."
"I CAN HEAR YOU SHITTING

well what else am I supposed to be doing in here lol"
What did you draw
This is the best thing ever haha
She would make a great banker
Spot on with instagram
"1:55 who knows, maybe she actually did fuck the Queen and we're none the wiser."
Bro that whistle is awesome
"Is it bad that im laughing?
actually asking"
She going bada ba ba ba I’m loving it
"This is just a reminder of how poorly we understand the brain, the mind and things like neural chemistry. It's amazing that we have advanced to the point where we can edit genes in CRISPR and research is progressing on things like potentially 3D printing organs, but we remain in the relative dark aged when it comes to the brain."
"I wish i was 20 years younger, i think you're amazing!🌹"
"""Know your dick, and fucking make it thick""... love it"
2:29 😵 I died of laughter
Lol just found your YouTube you crack me up
"0:06

Twitter awkward notification"
I love this girl she's amazing I couldn't stop laughing she's dope
Are you biscuit exclusive or will you also have your way with scones ? 😂😂
"hahahahahahahaha i just discovered this wonderful human,now i know where to go if i have a bad day.lovit!!!"
5:37 This one destroyed me 😊
What the fckkk her whistle is the best ive ever heard. Thats fckin skill right there
Im surprised that shes still spotless withh all the insult she shouts out in public. Lolz being cute kinda helps a wee bit.
Know your dick and make it thicc is such an iconic line
2:32 god dam girl!
hey (with rizz) u got tourettes rizz fr
I feel 90% of Anita's tics are 'truth tics'
Hello Love 💕 Xoxo 🔥🎉
"60% funny tics, 40% just her being straight up awesome"
We should play online i bet you i would kill her in mortal kombat  x mortal kombat 11 and soon  12
If she wasn’t hot people wouldn’t watch her or listen to her stream at all.
"yep another faker here what a pos. tourettes barely ever even affects women and her ""tics"" are clearly expected before they happen."
sweet anita is amazing im so glad i found her
gegege
Her whistle bro ♥️
“Bitch lasagna” PewDiePie would be proud😂
Honestly I wish I had her  Tourette
The whistle is nice
She’s not faking
You don't
"Amazing whistling. And I just discovered you and am on my second vid. Your Tourette's seems to flow really well with your intended speech. lol. With many, it's more pronounced. It's like sometimes it's obvious and other times I'm asking myself ""is she just joking, or was that the Tourette's?"" When you follow it with ""no, the Dr. didn't say that"" or whatever, then there is no mistaking it was the Tourette's,. But you can't remember to do that constantly, so we're left guess sometimes and that, is half the fun. hehehe. Seems like others have fun with it too and just go with it and chuckle. You handle it so well! I've seen plenty of people with Tourette's and you function far better than they do. It can be quite debilitating for some."
When you said bitch lasagna my tics responded with that's what you are
"Any picture u take is sexy, beautiful etc. U look good in green. Beauty doesn't have to be being half naked."
Her whistling talent comes from a bygone era. Reminds me of a wonderful B&W 1930's film.
Those whistles came straight out of a disney movie
Tuesday is my new favourite day🤔
"2:58
H O L Y   S H I T"
"Is it weird to say I like the weird and funny shit you say? Because you really have a sweet personality behind it all, even if the things that come out are seemingly inappropriate to others who don't understand your condition."
bitch lasagne
"Sweet Anita is such a character, and she handles her Tourette's very well."
I bet her biscuits are great. Teatime’s on me
The you too keep your head up bb
Biscit
Yours of course
Young and tender mmm
Dream it bb
Fun on the walk
Ok
Yeah bb
Your very honest I like that
That's slot of content to take in
Sounds like fun
When you are ready Anita LMK and I can make that happen..
Oh man the first one right off the back already has me happy. This is gonna be a fun one to watch.
This makes Miye dayy
NECK GERRRR!!!
Some of the things you’re condition make you say are so inappropriate but timed so flawlessly it’s freaking hilarious.
I fuck the queen hits different now
Anita i love you Babe ❤️
"Saying the N-word as a tic sounds utterly terrifying depending on who you are and what the context is. I have verbal stims from autism, but it’s clear they are not nearly as invasive or compulsive as your tics"
How the fuck!?!?!! I CANT EVEN WHISTLE!!!!!!!
"It’s brilliant how you’ve grown and become who you are today with that condition, such an inspiration girl!! Bravo"
She's faking
"Hello Anita,im a fan.youre pretty plus you have a accent. ."
"Wow her whistling is amazing, I can’t even whistle.

I’m not laughing at her condition I just find it very interesting. I honestly never knew this was a condition people could have. I would definitely love to be her friend."
I think that her terrerts are cute as hell. I'm sorry I laugh. But it's alittle funny. But still cool. My nephew has it and hits himself and spills alot of stuff. So I understand it.
I love the bird whistle tic of Sweet Anita
People who like her and girls which take her as an mother figure are actually as hot as her. Don't just see the hopeless dream of meeting a person like her. The more people watch her are getting more like her. This whole community of her are mostly the same thinking people like you are.
Lol this is so funny
I was just gonna say that
She’s not
 @Shayisboredd  👏👍
"I actually like it - it's like you are speaking to a completely honest person, which is a rare  chance"
OMG THE WHISTLING IS SO GOOD
"""Fuck the queen""


I CANT-😭😭😭😭"
Damn your whistling of songs is awesome
Feck a biscuits
Its weird how her tics are so subtle that sometimes it just sounds like she’s trying to be funny
youre a songbird 💖💖
racist
I have tourette lol
I love you dearly I love when you say fuck you Jesus and my name is Jesus you are adorable hun
"how are you at just not talking, do ticks still happen when your quiet."
"00:53 ""i dont have an instagram bc * twitter whisle"""
She seems to be a very amazing intelligent woman not to mention gorgeous .
Her whistle sounds like twitter
0:25 here we go lmao
You could enter competitions with that whistling I bet.
0:23 haha🤣😂
i wish i could whistle so good
Don't be ashamed of having tourettes
Dayum that is an epic whistle skill.
"She's friggin hillarious, I love it XD I laughed out loud in real life. I hope I don't go to hell for this"
"Holy shit, that whistling is GOD TIER"
Damn that whistling on point.
She doesnt fuck biscuits.
"Wait a minute, Anita is multinational?"
She is really nice 🙂 and that whistling is just incredible 🙂😀
bitch lasagna LOL
She's so damn cute omg
She exposes her searchhistory every time she talks
"She swears a lot, no doubt… but I think I have her beat and I don’t even have a disorder (other than being whacked)."
I just imagine there is like 7 spirits in her fighting it out to speak
"Hey, god you're awesome, keep being, er... awesome :)"
Shes such a fraud its ridiculous.
:O
"Can people with ticks, close their mouth with their hands, when saying inappropiate things?"
“I don’t have Instagram” does Twitter whistle 0:54
LASAGNA! dangit hungry now..
Am I missing something? She seems to talk normal ;)
We can but it’s not really gonna stop the tic. It can make it worse
Im jesus haha I like this girl
Omg I nearly choked on my food on that very last tic
Is the game name touretts
Whoa your whistling skills are amazing
Bitch. Lasagna. The BEST kind of lasagne 👌👌👌
1:28 I agree but when I ask for an Ig personally im just asking for the Ig 🤓
"I can't whistle, like not at all. You are amazing at it."
And B!tch lasagna need to be on a T-shirt.
"She should stream with the Geeks and Gamers crew, they would love her!"
"""I don't fuck biscuits, I fuck the queen."" That's a sentence I never thought I'd hear."
Ugh she's cute AF
The last one got me hahaha
i would be terrified sitting next to her if she had a loaded gun
Yo her whistling game is on another level
Omg her whistling skills…
I think cannabis could help to relax and control the anxiety. But you are funny as hell 😂
"Hay when i was blowing my nose allot and clearing my thought alot they said i had some disorder,,,,,it got bad when i started breaking stuff on my head"
Amazing girl
Why are your tics all so vulgar tho 🤣🤣
Are we supposed to forget that you used to trash video games saying they were sexist and misogynistic?????
Coprolalia is a symptom of Tourette's syndrome which makes you say things that are more vulgar
THAT WHISLING IS AMAMZING
"I fucked a biscuit, god fucked my biscuit 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹"
"ah yes, my favorite line, ""i dont fuck biscuits, i fuck the queen"""
the way she went 'bitch lasagna' had me rolling 😭😭
My whistling sucks.
"""Fuck the queen"" is my new Xbox tag."
She is good at faking.
"when was it diagnosed? when my dicc was on fire.

classic giveaway for tourettes"
Fake. Fake. Fake. You should be ashamed. I've put a curse on you. You are a despicable piece of crap.
"Well, you do have a point about dudes asking for Instagram, BUT also, on a dating perspective, sharing Instagram can also mean; “lemme see what this persons interested in, so I can have a thought about spending my time and energy with her/ him, or NOT.”

Also, your whistle skills are 💯 👌🏻"
"Oh wow I had no idea she was half Black, her father must be super light lmao"
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time 😂😂. Thanks Anita.
"do you know what make her so attractive? the tic, i know that sound bad i say that but i just feel that thing make her so attractive"
😐
"So she found profession where it's perfectly acceptable to swear profusely and say terms like ""fuck a biscuit"", ""fuck my cunt"", and ""bitch lasagna"". She probably swears less than other online gamers."
"It must be easy to be her. Get all the attention and get your way cause your pretty. Although I wouldnt know how to act being so pretty, all eyes on you all the time would make me very aware of myself and insecure. I guess being so pretty only works if you have the personality that can carry the looks. If you get what I mean. And evidently she got the confident personality so she carries her beauty with ease."
Love you
Good Lord her whistling is off the charts
How does she make that bubble popping sound
"years of whistling lead you to the camera.

Edit: Anita is a great example why public health is not as ideal as it may seem."
And you’re an expert?
I'm an expert in fuckery.
 @volkervison3000  it shows
Trust me you will see when her dumb ass gets exposed.
 @volkervison3000  you must be feeling real stupid
Not fake at all.
"counter curse, it's the ""You're a piece of shit"" curse, you're born with it, no one had to put it on you in the first place"
curse on you peice of dogshit
cope
Love that she is a nympho too
Unreal. You are unbelievable 👍🏻👍🏻
Haha your perfect 🤩
"If you were on a tv show, you’d sound like R2D2 from star wars"
"I feel so bad for laughing at the tics, but they genuinely feel like Youtube Poop mashups, and I love YTPs"
i love it
"I genuinely think her ticks are funny (in a respective way). 
""Bitch lasagna!"" I like that one alot"
Holy shit the trololol song.
Want you tics on my ringtone
She is the hottest girl on twitch
The moment when you realize her whistle has like an opera lyrical effect...
"She doesn't look like her dad is black. Also, she was raised by her single mom. So her N word story doesn't really stick."
when you were younger before being exposed to foul language what type of things would you say during a twitch
She's adorable
I’m wondering why is all her tics about dicks and cunts? Is it something that crosses her mind often and she involuntarily says it? I’m not being rude I’m seriously wondering why only uses filth words in her tics..
"Wait she's half black? lol. She must've gotten all her mom's genes. Idk why but I figured she looked a bit Pakistani or something, considering there are a lot of them in  the UK."
Never a dull moment lol brilliant hun
so this is the origin of b*tch lasanga!
🤔 Jesus said no thanks he's busy
My dicks on fire oh a little bit of lag my day in a nutshell
"She’s biracial, but her explanation makes perfect sense. For one, she cannot control what her tics make her do or say, and two, she’s mixed. Let it go."
"Stop being so obsessed with what she says, she has Tourette’s, stop being so invested in it"
 @aziza4654  But of course.
Coprolalia
if you can see all these clips are from a certain time that she probably ticked this often
"These are all mashups and they usually dont happen often, she has a condition called coprolalia Which sometimes can make her say inappropriate things she doesnt want to say."
So glad this isn't censored like all her videos on FB
Part of me isn't sure if it's legitimate  ....her tics seem pretty controlled.....why is it only sexual too.....
"Is that even genuine at all? With the stuff she says. That's not how it works, I'm pretty sure."
Banyanya
this is the most wholesome thing I've ever seen.
Буча! Краматорск ! Мариуополь!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Bro I'm sorry I feel bad for laughing💀
She whistles like every cartoon from the 50s. I love it
I love her because the random shit she says between her sentences made me spit out my drink like a pressurized water hose
Tourettes  doesnt exist people who claim to have Tourettes are just immature assholes who should have been beaten (more) by their parents. If Anita was my daughter I would suplex the Tourettes out of her.
"You should make a t-shirt that says ""Bitch Lasagna"" snd ""Fuck Biscuits"""
"“Thank you so much to everyone who’s touched my cunt and fisted my kitten”

I didn’t know Tourette’s was so bad"
2:55
"“I play with my dick on a Tuesday, fuck you and Jesus!”
I fucking love this girl! ❤️"
"I fucking love it!! I would love to hang out with her all the time, THAT IS GREAT"
"Does anyone know if she is ok with having these compilations, it’s literally “hahaha a disabled person is in pain compilation” - a person with Tourette’s"
she sounds like the twitter notification thing
I love her whistles 😂
..i want one 😍😍
ksp
"This is real. It doesn’t exactly seem controlled, and she has coprolalia, that’s why her tics are like that"
 @Shayisboredd  I have recently seen other videos and can see its real feel bad for saying other wise but people have been known to fake it its the world we live in now unfortunately that u even have to think someone could be lying about something like this. I use to have physical tics as a child because of ADHD and other issues it's not nice. Can't imagine how it must be to have tourettes having both feel for her tbh 😕 x
"It is genuine. Tics don’t have a specific way to how it works, it’s different for everyone"
ok bimbo
Said by a licensed medical physician. Your the type of person to climb over a glass wall too see whats on the other side.
"you aint get any child if youre like that, no person would touch you with any length of poles, youre definitely avoided like a plague victim"
"This is her channel, she made the compilation :)"
One what..
"""Know your d*ck and make it f*cking thick"" 
Wise words, wise words"
"I feel really bad, because I'm pissing myself from her tics but I know that she struggles with them

I should probably try not to laugh"
"Lol, I think the tics actually make her cuter, if that's even possible"
0:54 I don't have an Instagram because *Twitter Notification*
This shit yucky
I though i was the only one that fucked biscuits
Its so funny seeing how she can be a serious innocent girl then say some really freaky shit
I feel so bad when she is just trying to explain what games she's been playing other than the one mentioned
Her pc is 💩
"""Know your dick and fucking make it thick.""

That's some solid advice though not gonna lie"
She's not half black.
"""I can hear you shitting"" rules."
I love people with tiks its fucking funny
Is she really half black? I would’ve never guessed
Bitch lasagna!
Fuck me where did u learn to whistle like that ! Dame ! Epic melody
"Tourettes are like hiccups, you can't control them, they get annoying too."
she is a sweet heart honesty is great
That is next level whistling
I dropped dead from the bitch lasagna but we don't know her personally so I think it's fine
"This is why people started faking tourrettes, because they think its ""cute"" and ""quirky"" Not saying anita is faking it but alot of people have."
She's not even 1/8 black.
She is
Tell that to her dad lol
 @tonyc.7538  were you born stupid or did you learn it
Am I allowed to laugh at all?
"Damn, she can whistle the song real good. I was impressed"
Iam not a people person. But your someone i wouldn' like  to meet in life
Nah I felt that
your so fucking weird you should get banned for that shit
Did not know you were half black
Good to see some people still play bioshock
I think it’s very funny when she has a tick not being disrespectful it’s just funny 😆
what game?
Does she really have tourettes
"""I... don't have an instagram because *twitter notification"""
The biscuit one is awsome.
2:58 troll
Calling her cunt The bearded Dragon. A nice name tbh🤣🤣🤣

Girlschool beautiful song nice band
"Your parents are rockers.  My parents hated rock, but I am older."
"I played in band's most of my life and the 80s were my favorite time of all!
 I miss that era- no other time matches that, not even close."
Cool band...but can't stand the singers voice.
Heavy metall Ladys rocks
Were the girl's in 80's rock videos bred in a lab somewhere? So amazing!
Болотная ведьма одурела от сильвера.моргана.довела Монте крю.паразитку рыжую .до тоиаты
He sounds like a muppet singing.
"There was an old school rap parody song called He Wants to Potty all the Time by Bobby Jimmy & the Critters. There biggest hits were Roaches, New York Rapper & L.A. Rapper."
Looks like it smells really good in that classroom.
nothing sexier than a woman dancing to rock and roll
How many of those girls are grandma's?
Doesn't sound like ACDC at all. LMAO
I love this video ❤
Hell yeah 👍
"I had this cassette tape when i was a kid and living in a trailer park. There was this girl named Brittany that lived there on the one ""street"" our park was on. I had a crush on her and one day I called her Brittany Fox, because she was indeed foxy - I got kneed in the balls so hard that day by her that I still feel it today. Worth it. the 80's were incredible."
a good of rock as any to hide under... except that the rapists costed you alot of your family.... like some of the real ones that you needed to meet.🖕
I got you ❤
Hell fucking yes😂
Ведьма пегая одурела от Джона моргана.800ватт колонок Jvc...довели старую дуру.монте Крю.
I really remember this video  from back in the day and it's a very good video to watch and I think it's just the coolest part my life I've ever known and it was just one thing that I would have done for years with hard rock and heavy metal videos and watch them all the time lol
These guys were so horribly awesome. Love this song...
Потоскуха ведьма ведьма.одурелы от одеколона  шипр.
Maybe they should play this one for the country !! schools !! too calm everybody down just saying
His teeth are like Chicklettes
Is this real or a joke?  I honestly don’t know.  Like an SNL spoof?
Dentro de las 40 más malas. Y aún así... como que suena cool.
"Remember 80s rock/metal like this?  No politics, no agenda, no guilt trips, no pissing off half their fan base -- just a rockin' tune about good times.  I always thought this video was fun too, the way the teacher joins in by the end, hehe!  That's us rockers from the 80s onward: everyone's welcome, after you work hard you deserve a good time too."
FUN VIDEO!   HA!
Cinderella copy.
Обоссали ведьма довели Монте Крю.до мурдагима

"I was sent to a boyschool in the 80's, and it wasn't like this."
Britney spears
My best hair american rock band... 🖤🔥🖤
I am very happy I grew up when I did.  What America has become blows
This is still so awesome after 34+ years.
The 80s were the best ever
Brittany spears got the idea from this for her video one more time
A time when you could look up chick's skirt and it was cool. 🤣
My god this is awful lmao. And all you saying “todays music sucks”😂 this is generic hair metal trash with a wannabe Bon Scott singer
If time travel was real ID go back and never even think about 2023 or the last 30 years.
"Wasn't Brittany Fox a porn star from
the 80's? 🤔😲"
I was 15 when this came out. God how I wanted to know where that school was located.
This is fun shit
I always thought these fools looked like a bunch of used car salesmen with really cheap horrible wigs on!!!!😅😅😅
I'm still dancing

"Fun song!! I had this on cassette tape, lol. Just not enough wave left in hard rock for these guys to ride to stardom."
80s rock was the best but whoever told this guy he could sing. OMG.
God i miss the 80's
Love it!
"Britny Fox – Girl School

Come on girls!


A school bell rings off the day,
Brings in a stray a few girls at play.
Cut school pink slips are fine
For a good time there's boys on their mind.

A bad girl smoking in school,
Breaking the rules acting real cool.
Talkin' 'bout all the rock boys,
Back seat joys with some boy's toy.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

Saddle shoes uniforms blue,
Love all the girls in the girlschool.
Traffic jam in the hallway
Ooh I'm gonna stay this makes my day.

Well here they come girls from the school,
Breakin the rules hot on the loose.
My girl left right from school,
Came over to my house, ooh...

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

You're stayin' after school

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
Girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

Loose Hips
Slips of mine,
For a good time,
Boys on their mind

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules

"Imagine if this song were released today, some people would be mad there weren't any dudes wearing dresses..."
@missdarlene7 OMG 😃 What a FINE and SEXY BADASS Guitar 🎸 Player and a FINE and SEXY BADASS DRUMMER too 😍‼️❤️ Sincerely Darlene an American Girl Who has a thing for drummers ❤️❤️❤️
Back when no one really cared if 30 year old dudes were macking on 16-17 year old high school girls.
Headbangers ball......what happend to MTV.
With you 🔥
I love this song🎵
"Right-wing propaganda in an 80's music video? 
LMFAO!!!"
great band excellent song
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I love this song 😁😊😇💘💖❤️‍🔥💚💜💜💙 such  amazing singer 😁😊😇💖💓💓💞💖💜💙💚
"I love the song, and as a teen I thought the video was the sh!t!! As a 50 year old man, I think it's a little cringe worthy"
This is ok except for every time the guy is singing.
high school girls today...most addicted to drugs and smartphones you can wear a tiger skin thong on the street and they won't look at you...👎👎
I miss so much longe hair rock times...😥😢😥
Rock n Roll is forever memories of it never dies
Absolutely 🥁🎸!!!!!!!
"Those skirts got rolled up in a hurry. The nuns said the shorter the skirt, the longer the confession"
"also, kim anderson (the main character or whatever) sure was somethin"
Great vibe. Song you can sing along with. Not nasty and dark. There's a time and place for everything ☺
Spinal taps parody bitch school was equally as good.lol
Geniales
Damn I love this song and this music video
The teacher looks like big hoss from pawn stars
very cool that they put one (1) asian girl in the video for diversity
Lucky to have been born in 71 to enjoy the great dance music..80s for breakdancing..MJ Prince Madonna etc..and Then we get gems like this and other rock/metal/classic rock etc..YEP..there is a reason our generation is the most loved and celebrated..
Saw these dudes at Bogart's before their album was even released opening for a couple of other hair bands winger was the other one and there was one more don't remember who
"Really big hair on guys was destined to burn out fast, but OMGawd how I miss big hair, sexy girls and 80s fashions. Besides whiney bummer lyrics and music that sounded like it was recorded in a cardboard box, it still irks me how much greatness grunge killed."
"I just love how the teacher is just as much a part of the party as the students at the end of the video. If you can't beat them, join them!"
🤘😆🤘
"Back when hot chick's were cool instead of mulatto feminists with big nasty hair, fat chick's with mustaches, hairy armpits, pants pulled up to their necks, and transgender freaks."
Doesn’t get much better
Почему училка не колотит всех по бошкам огромным дилдосом 🤣🤣🤣❓
I worked with a girl who was a dead ringer for the hot one when this video came out.
The cooolest thing that EVER happened to me was being 16 years old in 1984!! What a wild ride it has been!
I'm not s big Britney Fox fan but they really rocked the shit on this one
I had a walkman just like that one.
Take me back to the 80’s please 🙏🏼
"Критиковать за похожесть, копирование конечно можно - Long live Rock n Roll forever 💖❤️ ! Ukraine."
Laughable lyrics. Nothing original about this band. Dime a dozen.
You know it!
You've just got to love this song. Big hair and a great video. Rock it girls. Steve
Brian  Johnson used a lot of hairspray
Always got time for an 80'S hair metal video
It reminds me of my high school days where I was the only boy at anall girls school
🌠🇮🇩💤 🤟
See how hot the girls were back then?
Who cares
One of the BEST songs from the '80's.
there is no one i need more than dean davidson
"This vocal make me sick of love in scream drive vocal.
I need more off this bizarre tone"
Looks like Kelly Kapowski...but even hotter
damn what a hot chick .....
80’s will never die!
Beula Ballbreaker.
"We went from rocking out on our way to the drive-in movies, to rocking back and forth in our rooms tapping likes on a screen."
When I was a teenager in the eighties this song was the jam. Now that I'm 52 if I sing this I expect Chris Hansen to pop from around the corner.
Is that Tom Kieffer from Cinderella?
Not bad for a bunch of pretty boys.
"Kim Anderson is absolutely gorgeous in this video!  I had the biggest crush on her back in the 80s when this video came out.  I loved this band and was sad to see Dean Davidson leave.  But he put out some great albums with Blackeyed Susan, while Britny Fox just wasn't the same with Tommy Paris."
Хороший отдыхающий Глэм в Украине сегодня - Хорошо убивать насильников мародёров русских палачей окупантов !
Rock On 🎸🥁🌟‼️
Walkmans were expensive back then.....
Does the teacher mean Sebastian Bach from Skid Row 😂😎????
When your classroom turns into a real show even with headphones on <3
The girls r smokin hot n the video.
I didn't know Dominic West was in a band.
Hard to tell between these guys and Cinderella
80s music  is what made Mother Earth  perfect  she loves  it Generation x calls the shots
It is a miracle that I enjoyed Britney Fox when tear gas flew around in the 1980s due to the Korean democracy struggle.
😂😂😂😂😂
MAGNIFICENT....GRANDUSSIMI
I want to go back to those dayzzz 🤘💯✌️😎
"My initial thoughts were: If you suck bad enough to get thrown out of Cinderella then…ouch. I actually prefer these guys. Just as talented, don’t take themselves so seriously."
진심으로 사랑해 바보야 메롱 메롱
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ완이와 바보 구체적으로 귀엽고 사랑스럽다  ㅋㅋㅋㅌ
"As cool as this song is , is it as cool as the female band by the same name? 999 emergency!"
I'd swear the girl at 3:03 is Tiffany Amber-Thiessen (from Saved By The Bell)
When Kiss meets Cinderella
My favorite band of my era. Probably some of the best musicians of any band
There is an awesome alternate version on Amazon Echo (Alexa) currently!
"Sorry, sounds like a bad AC/DC cover band....The riff is good singer sucks."
I saw these guys at the EMPIRE ROCK CLUB in northeast Philly
I don’t wanna be a pirate.
This band had so many line-ups…Cinderella-lite
Howling!
"They look and sound like Cinderella. Oh well, Motley Crue, Ratt, Dokken, Winger, Warrant, Whitesnake, White Lion, Slaughter, Extreme, Bullet Boys, LA Guns, Firehouse, Mr. Big, Guns and Roses. All looked the same after real Heavy Metal In the early 80's."
"Was ist das eigentlich für ein ""Hinack""? Dem glaubt eh niemand, dass er was auf die Reihe bekommt, außer in's Klo kacken."
Just as talented...who are you trying to fool?
 @Rjensen2  Fool? Cinderella was discovered by freaking Bon Jovi. Enough said.
"Disagree. Dean went a little over the top with the screech, but a competent front man."
And you're better?? 😂
" @jcalvert9955 No, I have been asked NOT to sing before....in church,  but I'm not the one on stage screaming into a microphone."
"These guys were the classic ""here and gone"" bunch, but while here, they ROCKED !!!!!!!"
"This video is a smorgasbord of hot. Glam was energetic, fun and had some great anthems!!! I want to break all the rules at the girls school!!!😍"
"awesome, even compared to other clips from the eighties"
"As a young hard rock singer in the late 80's and early 90's I lived this life   well as much as a country boy from a small town in the mountains of East TN could. I packed up and moved to LA in 1992 at the age of 20. Spent lots of nights on the Sunset Strip. Went straight from the mountains of East TN to the Sunset Strip. Culture shock to say the least, but I had the look and fit right in but it wasn't to be..."
Saw Britny Fox open for Ratt in like 1989. I think I was the only one wearing a Britny Fox tee the next day at school.
"Damn, I forgot how hot the chicks were in this video!"
"November 2022, still here! It’s my dream to meet them!
❤️ I love whom all supported and commented! 
I’m BRITTANY (BRITNY)! ❤️😘"
There is lots of problems with the curriculum there...time for teacher conference lol😆!
Rad voice. You're the new Steven Tyler. It's your time now.
Bad ass song! Jam to this in a 1987 Ford Ranger 4X4 that smells like Marlboro reds and budweiser inside lol 😆 🤘
🍻🤘
🔥🔥
the days when mtv played music...I was 13 when the 90's hit. I grew up with all this stuff. roller skating box metal..miss those days
"Stuppid but yeah Im a fan its funny, and that  is all it as to be."
Hottest video ever!!!!
"I'm a Punk Rocker / Metal Head, and I'd listen to this kind of music full blast,  so my neighbors could hear it too, and no one would say anything,  because my Daddy was a bad ass mother fucker,  and he'd kick ass over me, and we were living on base too! LOL 😆  I was consider a "" bad girl "" by some of the up tight parents on base, because my parents let me date GIs and Bikers, and when one of those prudes would try and say something about me,  my Daddy would ask them how did they stand it living with a boring kid? LOL 😆  The rest of the parents on base thought that I was cool as hell, and that my parents were doing a great job with raising me, and would ask them advice on parenting. LOL 😆 🤣"
I haven't heard this song in over 33 years. They need to add this song to Peacemaker
shite metal
"Simple  song  , kicks ass  !!"
🦧👍
"Crap, mostly crap but i remember when it was ok, but yes this was dumb even then,"
Great song..
He sounds like he's always on the brink of doing an Elmo impression
Man the singer… come on!! How did we not know that was a wig ! Total copy of Cinderella
Make a note all these girls not a heifer among them what makes him so hot looking no tramp stamps no piercings a little bit of make up that’s all you need to look fine
No denying it Obama clan
Bwahaha Lol that's cheezy
"I'm totally an 80s hair band guy but I never heard of this.  I like 80s cheese but this a bit too much even for me.
Glad if you all like it."
Wee wee on MAMA
I’m up for night classes! 😘
Love the song and the sparkly guitar
Who's still listening 2022!? now 2023?
Great fun song that brings back some memories of some awesome parties where...uh-huh...lots of dancing in the sheets.
I'm named after this band 🤣 cause of my dad....

Guess this is why we have a gender pay gap.
It's spelled different.
Who's watching  in 2022
i like the way they sound a mix between Cinderela and tesla
"Obvious Cinderella ripoff is obvious.  I remember when these guys came out, and they were a joke then.  They, along with Warrant and the like, were the cause of the downfall of hair metal.  So many better bands in that genre and time."
Man I love 80s metal
Effin' Bad Ass Shit Right There ..I Remember The Day ...
Love it I’m 66
"being a teen when this came out, gave me a whole different turn on for catholic school girls hehehehehehe"
I love how all the girls slowly start turning into a classroom full of Kelly Bundy's the longer the video goes on.
Lagu ini gila banget... Apalagi video klipnya.
The teacher in this video is also the school lunch lady on the shoe Mike and Molly.
"My wife has been the best mom and partner in crime, but this is so her.  Long live the 80s"

Those were some hot chicks  👍
Guitar rock!

Reliving 8th grade tonight and going back to 1988!
Dizzy Dean beats Tom Keifer
I feel so damn old I'm only 28 lol
this song is the reason rock crashed.  phonies in phony tails
Man 80's chicks were so hot!!!! My high school sweetheart was very hot!!! While we took separate paths after high school. Almost 40 years later we still have remained close friends!!!!
Wonder what happened to all these girls in the video. Pretty sure they're in their mid 50's now.
Oh yeah back than girls look like girls and they like boys just saying.
Bring back hair metal
"Definitely the best video ever created, gets my blood pumping, delicious ladies dancing, thank you"
Whats the girls name w headphones?  Daamn
I am 53.this is.my.wheel house 🏘️
"This girl with the headphones is so tight I must see more of her, mercy!!!"
Tronchatoro II
Lyrical masterminds...
god i miss the 80s sighhh
They got some shows coming up Facebook said🤘
Is the band's bass players instrument even plugged in or the volume only turned up to half of one?
I preferred to meet women on the beach instead of a nightclub. Much better place of life.
"The band, ""Stryper"" came to the scene then. They worked hard to get church girls."
Sexy Bitches and a Pervert High School Janitor. I get it-:) Rock On
Wow that chick looks Jennifer Grey's way hotter sister. That raven haired girl pretty banging as well. Best cheese 80's video ever. This was the NJ/Philly B-team after Cinderella but still a great party track.
This sucks 😆
"do you really want to know?

even that is a pretty scary thought"
Yep
Wow!  That was shit.
Me encanta este videoooo!!!!
ROCK ON.... LOVE U GUYS.... GOD BLESS U GUYS
Such a cool song
"Back when girls were girls and girls WERE 🔥HOT🔥,don't get me wrong there are hot girls today but the girls back then were a different kind of AWESOME HOT 😍"
"Not the biggest band, but they had the biggest hair."
"Seen them back in the day...hung out with the drummer after the show...cool dude...miss those days...
Have a pic sumwhere...4gwt who they opened for?"
"I saw Britney Fox with Lita Ford and Poison in Houston,Texas in 1988 at the Summit Arena"
KILLER GUITAR PLAYER....and he played a les paul!!!!!
Yet another 80s band that got kind of overlooked due to the vast number of killer metal bands of the era.  What the hell happened to real music?
the singer sounds like udo off accept
The effect of the band turning into the blackboard and back is amazing for the 80's. I'm in awe. And it's just a little thing in the whole song/video. Really cool.
I love this!  This was before the 90’s when feminism infected everything.  Love the 80’s!!!!
"Oh back to the days when music was music. I love the rock band style of the 80's/90's (to name but a few, and I mean a few... Metallica, Queen, Def Leppard, Poison, Bon Jovi, Vixen (all female)!, and so many others. These people did not need synthesisers or backing, they were true musicians, so much better than todays mainstream artists (and I am not knocking them, I just think this era was so much more talented as natural musicians without all the modern technology - I am sure I will get a slating for this)."
One of the best videos ever. Wish I went to that school.
"0:48  they stole that main riff off Led Zeppelin's 'Hey, Hey, What Can I Do!"
Michael Kelly Smith....fuck yes!!!!¡
Eternal masterpiece！！
The greatest decade.
What if AC⚡️DC pick Brittany fox to be the lead singer of the band . How do you think it would of turn out .
The Music Industry was a lot more honest back then
More so like Tom Keifer.
MTV reality shit shows  didn't help anything either.....
 @davidseal8375  Indeed!! 👍
Is the teacher played by Louise Fletcher?  It looks like her.
"Wow this is awesome.

I’m surprised this never blew up and got more famous. I guess people have bad taste."
"1988, what a year"
So just a shitty version of Meral Health by Quiet Riot?
"What A great song by ""Cinderella"" oops sorry by Britny Fox"
Lose him... you've lost it all...
Cinderella fucked up...mks....
Cinderella knock offs but still good
THE DOWNSIDE IS THE SINGER SUCKS ! HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED !
Even Ballbreaker was having fun by the end of this one!
Some good hard rock right here. 😎
"This song, Kiss, and Chad all suck"
This band is the reason why everyone spells my name wrong. 🤣
I'm head banging and having a blast!
These jams sure do take me back to the good old days 👍🎤🎸
Holy shit!! I totally forgot about this band thanks for sharing God damn '80s memories 👍👍👍
whats this song about? anyone know?? I'm curious 🤔
makes me miss my moped
Yeaaahhh Britney kkkkkkk
Cheesy and fun
"Well there were 20 other bands doing the same thing, it was hard to really break out by the time these guys hit the scene. But they were one of my faves at the time. I got to see them live."
I don’t see much similarity…
the line “you’re staying after school” should be a dead giveaway
"2:35.  The way they made 'em in the 80s.  Btw, no disgusting overload of tats."
"I tolerate this song, but this dude was a cheap Tom Keifer copy."
Wow this dong berings back memories thats when girl's where 🔥 i miss the 80s😃😃😃💪
Holy shiT! I FORGOT About this
"Ah, when adults were still worth rebelling against!  Now they are just trying to be one of the cool kids."
"Fourteen yr old me, first concert... Ratt, Britney Fox, Kixx"
Not even McFly can do this better man!
God I’d love to experience this 😭
Every girl in this video is a grandma now
https://youtu.be/Xi9teicIgRI
"I love the girl's face at 0:58 as her expression changes from jaw-drop, to some kind of ""oh yeah!"" smile. Brilliant. 17-year-old me liked this a lot."
Who wouldn’t love a school full of these girls?!?!
Blatant rip off of Cinderella
Fun. A+
Horrible 😂
"What a fun song. I was in high school when this came out. I didn't realize until years later that the teacher in this video is Ballbricker from Porky's. 80's worlds collide. 
I was reading in another comment section that the model Kim Anderson kind of disappeared and even with social media, nobody can find her. She so lucky she got to play in so many videos in the heyday of hair bands."
"Miss Tallywacker is my Dream Teacher!
I'm gonna RIDE THAT BEEST!"
Great song I love driving to work blasting this song singing along to it 🤘🎸
Makes all my problems and aches go away. Love it!
it's too hard listen it for me. heartbreaking.
10 years+ and its still entertaining 😂
Awesome
"You are a core memory for me. First saw this back in the metacafe days, and this video of yours is one of the first ones i've ever downloaded. Every now and again, I come back to this video and share it with my friends. Thanks for making this."
Genuine!
"I remember seeing this video over a decade ago when I was in high school
Never gets old"
"Roomie (1 guy, [𝒙 number of] voices) needs to see this lol"
ended up listening to Robbie Robertson - Somewhere Down The Crazy River it's a strange one!
Just watched a Bob Anderson sampler. Rick could give him a run for his money.
Still better than Kanye
"Great performance Rick, surprised it does not have more views."
"Really, I dont get why people dont react to this yet...."
"Melhor vídeo, não me canso de ver!"
"Rick!!! This is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! What an honour to work with you. 
-Alix"
what is the voice on 03:19? Crash test Tommie's?
Legend!
"So nostalgic, saw this when i was 12 and loved every second of it. Still do"
Love this ever since I first saw it years ago ! ☺️
Hey Rick I’ve always wondered: is that you doing the announcer voice-over too?
"Barney, julio iglesias, boceli, james hetfield, jagger, axl rose were pretty good hahaha"
"Can't tell you how many times I've watched this video in my life, i have it bookmarked since i was a kid and watch it at least once per month to this day, thank you for this masterful performance.👏"
Thanks! It's actually almost 25 years old. I think I recorded that in 2000!
@Rick Miller  honestly think it was the first video I randomly found on YouTube 😂 epic!
Hey thanks!
"Hey, thank you. I get a lot of surprises like this - people who saw this video in the early days of the internet, and it brings them back some good memories. Thanks for letting me know."
"Thanks, Nicole!"
"Thanks! Glad you still like it. It was filmed over 20 years ago, and some of it makes me cringe! ;)"
"Right? In later versions of this song, I replaced Robbie Robertson because not many people knew of him. But I do love that song"
"Ha. I think that's a compliment. Thanks, Shafin. Rick"
"Thanks. There seem to be a few other versions other there, and one of them has 1 million +."
"Thanks, Alix! Glad the video still makes people happy, though it makes me cringe!!!"
Hey Misha. It's the Crash Test Dummies. Canadian band that were big in the 1990s. http://www.crashtestdummies.com/
" @RickMillerActor  thank you Rick. By the way, if its you administrating your channel, I want to tell you that  it was a really great and talented performance, I watched it in 2006, its huge! Greetings from Ukraine."
" @miku7904  Thanks, Misha. Yes, I take care of all my channels, and am happy to do so. Ukraine - where are you in the country? Obviously, what you are going through is of topmost concern to everyone I know, and I wish you health and well-being as you navigate this challenging time in our shared history."
" @RickMillerActor  Thanks you for understanding and help. I believe such artistic people as you feel it very clearly. I am from Kyiv, and all ukrainians want this war to stop. It will be over when russians will stop it, because it depends on them too. Thank you and good luck Rick!"
"Thanks, Matias!"
Thanks for the comment. I did this when I was 30 and still love to hear that people enjoy it (and get nostalgic!)
"Thanks, Jenn! I love that you still love it - seems like another lifetime to me."
"Yup. Love doing announcer/""movie trailer man"" voices. And I get to say what I want!"
 @RickMillerActor  It's up there with Pablo Francisco's announcer voice. Well done!
"José, thanks for this. I'm glad it keeps making you happy (even though it makes me cringe - so long ago!). All the best. Rick"
I first saw this before YouTube even existed. I'm still enjoying it 20 years later.
One of my favorite videos to this day <3
"The first time I heard about this dude was from a kid's show that I used to watch when I was young called My Big Big Friend. And years later when I found out Rick Miller did stand up, this video came in my recommendations. And I gotta say this is better than the original bohemian rhapsody."
Don't remember when did I seen it for the first time. I've seen it way to many times. If the world and internet will ever go down in flames and I somehow happen to survive this video will one of not too many that I will try to replay in my brain like a proper crazy guy I will be. One of the best things ever put on the internet.
I come here to watch it at least once every year and it never gets old 😆
YOU ARE GENIUS/ THIS IS MASTERPIECE/ Never gets old/ THANK YOU
"This always makes my day everyday. Laugh loudly when I wake up. 
You really get the spot of every singer hahaha. 
Look forward to Boom in Taichung  Theatre, and hope I have the opportunity to see Boom X(my generation) and YZ in Taiwan."
"Man, many of these are spot on. My favorites were Dennis Di Young, Meat Loaf, Crash Test Dummies, Tom Petty (R.I.P.), AC/DC, Andrea Bocelli, and Guns n' Roses."
i don't know what unlocked the memory of seeing this years ago but i'm glad i could it again
Thank you very much for remembering Teenager time. Now with a better quality next to the the upload I watched. And again thanks to this much better sound quality
This performance is so unique! In that every impression is gradually worse than the one before it.
"2021, my friends!"
still here in 2020
"What are you up to nowadays, Rick?"
Awesome 👍 Love it😁
"You should go on ""America's Got Talent""; your impersonations are really impressive!!"
Maravilloso Robbie robertson
Rick you have to do a 2020 remake of this! I love this video so much! Been watching it for 10 years.
"Bravo,  especially like the rolling stones and axle rose , awesome  performance"
"Hey Rick, hope this is actually you, but this performance was one of the reasons I wanted to be a comedian. I've been doing some gigs for the past couple years, open mics and such. I credit you, Robin Williams, and George Carlin for making me want to get into this. Thank you man."
"Thanks, Vlad. Hope you still enjoy it 20 years from now. Who knows if YouTube will still exist?"
" @RickMillerActor  I'll still be enjoying this ""when I'm 64"" :)
Happy New Year, Rick!"
"Thanks, Sanja! Glad it still makes you happy."
"Thanks for this! Yeah, I played Bongo on My BBF, but singing this song was always a blast. It's over 20 years ago, so I die a little bit watching it, but I'm glad it still makes people happy."
Yes!!! I thought I was the only one!!!
"Hey, thanks so much! Although I hope if the world breaks down in flames, I don't spend it wearing that stupid shirt."
"Aw, that's nice to hear, thanks Natalia!"
Thanks so much! Glad you still like it - it's over 20 years old now!
" @RickMillerActor  Are you kidding/ I've been watching this amazing video since 2010. Once a month. 20 years doesn't matter. It's an eternity, in my opinion. This is the greatest musical parody I've ever seen"
" @user-zy5zj4hy7w  Hey, thanks again. You're very kind!"
Hard to do MacHomer in quarantine
He’s Canadian :)
Oh man! Very nice to see you again!
"Saw this when I was a kid and it damn near killed me it was so funny. Years later, still love it!"
"Good release, keep it up ;) I make also some queen covers on my channel, if you have time to give me your opinion :)"
Neil Young had me cryin but that Aerosmith one was GOLD.

"Tried searching up your name to find some Dark Prince quotes, and stumbled upon this video. I'm really glad, got a good laugh out of it"
33 people with no taste or sense of humor have been by here.
Most of this was really cringeworthy the but the Axl impression was fucking hilarious.
"Fun fact, Rick Miller is the voice actor for the Dark Prince in Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones. I know that this might be common knowledge but there are some who did not know of it so I'm going to mention it here. If you do know about this fact, then you can disregard this comment."
Genius.
0:14 It sounds like G0Z the clown.
Schäm dich
Easily one of the best comedy acts I've ever seen! Thank you Rick Miller!
His Axl Rose impression is spot on
He’s molking queen
Lol I got confuse when I started the video cuz I thought that was his voice😂🤣😂 I was like mmm ok
I first saw this gorgeous video about 7 years ago. And I saw the movie 'Bohemian Rhapsody' two days ago. So    I search and watch this video again and again!
Still the best
"""Nothing really matters... except me"" Genius😂"
"Thanks, Billy!"
"Thanks, Floyd. I feel like I was a kid when it was filmed! 20 years ago... yikes."
"Thanks! It was eons ago - 20 years actually, so I can't bear to watch it anymore - but I'm happy people still get some fun out of it!"
"Thanks, CG! Yup, that was one of the toughest recording sessions I've ever done. When you play the ""bad guy"" in a game, you have to die a million different ways!"
Thanks a lot! Glad you like it.
"Thanks so much! really appreciate that - and I hope you enjoyed the Queen movie. I loved it, of course. So did my two daughters."
"His Axl is so good it almost makes up for that dismal Ozzy impression.

Also, AC/DC isn't a person."
genius!!!!
"Unmatched classic, criminally underwatched."
"One of those videos you come back to  - again and again - even after years.

Awesome performance. So hilarious."
"Rick, if you're there, I love your entire performance, but I especially like to tap the YouTube time bar at the bottom and listen to you sing the Crash Test Dummies and AC/DC bits over and over, and let my brain soak in the pure dopaminergic pleasure they give me. 

I can't really explain why they're so much fun to listen to...they just tickle my neurons the right way."
This is first time in long time laughing this hard! lol
Es increíble! No me canso de verlo! ¿Podrían escribir los cantantes? Algunos no los entiendo- Gracias!!
Żałosne.
Wonderful esp the Opera you are one talented dude.
OMG my 6 minute is gone
The Barney impression had me cracking up!
Absolutely Hilarious haha
It was uploaded 3 years after the other one...
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AMAZING!
"
"It's not only the voices he's trying to mimic for most of them, but their mannerisms as well. All together I think he does a great job!"
This guy is incredible
"I love this!
"
COOL!
fucking epic!
"Seen this in 2000 and it still never gets old.

I salute you, Rick.
"
Neither is Aerosmith. Oh well.
Sheesh! Where's YOUR 25 impersonations?
+Sean Wilkinson Thanks Sean!
Aaron Neville was dead on too.
Mannerisms are 75% of good impressions
I don't feel he actually hits the spot on any of the voices.
it never gets old <3

There is no such thing as trans animals
You are a sad piece of work
"These are not society's needs. These are society's wants. Nowadays all everyone wants to do is either be 'special' or fit in with the norm. People be out here ranting out how much trauma they've been through in such a tone as if they were listing medals. I bet they wouldn't even know true horror if they saw it. It's all just a competition of how much you've been abused or how different you are. Also everybody has a strange 'need' to fight over everything. Meanwhile I'm watching all this go down and I'm like what has happened? Yeah life is tough, but we can change that. I'm not saying I'm any different from these people. At least I'm admitting it. To be honest I'm tired of all this nonsense people come up with. There are people that actually speak wise words and make sense. And there are people who straight up belong in a mental asylum. Is people what I even refer to as humankind anymore? Is the 'human' bit offensive? We need to think before we speak. Before we can fix the Earth we need to fix the people."
We are all part of the animal kingdom. Trace does a great job at explaining the intricacies of biology and how messy it can be.
Pride is 24/7 -_-

"Transgenderism for the human mammals still should be a scientific anomaly, not a naturalistic propaganda of human development, otherwise we the human species of the future will become an anomaly ourselves or turn into lizard humanoids."
But why should we promote this a social/political ideology these days?
5:00 Gives a new meaning to “I just can’t wait to be king!”
"Ha 🤔.... So God made everything. Including the animals in nature that exhibit signs of gender & sex not being aligned but somehow it's not ""natural"" for a human? He doesn't make mistakes sooo 😆. As an ally I knew this stuff but not enough to explain it like this. Glad I found this so I don't have to say anything anymore I can just drop a link 😆. Wonder what other excuse I'll hear for being hateful of how someone else chooses to live THEIR LIFE"
Life is strange yet interesting and beautiful.
This whole video is strecheeeeeeeed
"Pride is a propaganda word straight out of the book of the soviets….

They do and use what ever words they like and here is the same thing."
I got here by searching “trans animals” 😂
😂😂😂
The answer: yes because clownfish change genders
"There actually are transgender animals, Google is a resource ya know"
"I personally believe that ANY animal, cat, dog, snake, bird, can be transgender if they want. 
I myself am a transgender cat and stand up for others like me.

"0.6% of Americans identify as transgender, that number is steady over time and not growing. Do you really think such a small percentage are worth you worrying about this?"
" @TraceDominguez  Maybe not, but they're overly exposed by our media, both conservative and liberal, overly represented it seems."
The needs of us many should always outweigh the needs of the few.
" @mikhailthetenor3387  I agree! But… the news stories are happening a lot because “if it bleeds it leads.” This 0.6% is being attacked a lot with laws, bans, and literal physical attacks — those things make the news. I have never seen a news story celebrating how great it is to be oppressed."
 @TraceDominguez  Whatever.
"Trace, you are such an excellent teacher. I say that as a professor myself.  Your information is presented with humor, accuracy and is never dull. I have shared this video many times.  Bravo, my friend!"
Well done! This is the best break down of identity and expression I’ve seen. Definitely going to save this to rewatch

There are NOT trans animals! I know because I studied marine biology.
nah.

Can you do video talking about how throughout history humans have shown that we're statistically most likely bisexual however the only reason we do not function that way is simply because of society. Roman some of the manliest men to ever man had gay orgies before battle...
I'm that a**** that constantly reminds people that humans are mammals and mammals are animals.

Cool!!! 🏳️‍⚧️
Creation explains why we are here not evolution. We have beginning and end. God did not leave to wonder. Man refuses to ask his word as truth so they can live they old sinful life without feeling guilt. But one day God will judge the world for this wickdness

"MY afab dog has been exhibiting some masculine behavior as of late. She prefers wearing black leather collars with skull and crossbones on them.  She start peeing with one leg up as apposed to squatting. She also seems more interest in male dog activates like chasing squirrels and barking at strangers. As a supportive trans pet owner I'm just wondering what I should do. Are there dog hormones or possibly bottom surgery for her? Her dead name is Kaya but now it's been changed to Bonecrusher. 

thanks for listening."
"No, except humans and maybe some chance at other apes, there are not transgender animals, because gender is social construct produced by highly developed societies like our (developed in comparison to other animals societies). For that, you need to have some degree of advanced brain to work with concept of gender, sexuality etc."
"If the answer is no, half of me will be sad, and the other half will cry."
"Thank you, Daniel!"
Clownfish?
" @ant445  do it naturally, no hormone treatments and surgery required"
"There are snakes in addition to fish which change sex midlife.  They actually go from male to female or vice versa.  Every human fetus started as female.  Some go on to grow a penis. Others stay the same.  Technically, a cis gendered male is trans."
 @ant445  male clownfish change their biological sex when there isn't a dominant female but most animals cant

well done for a very complex subject that has no simple categories
"What do you mean the lionesses' manes are a form of gender expression?? Saying appearance equals gender expression is not logical, since the manes are something their body develops, not a choice of how to express themselves like humans choose their hairstyle or clothing..."
Lol what the Fu$# did I click on. Fu#$ed up people. Lol
Even though i’ve lived in the us and i loved it .. i really hope that this messy backwards emotional thinking doesn’t carry on getting crazier .. because we might have people identifying as dogs or cats because that’s  what they feel like inside and they want to express themselves and nobody has a right to tell them anything
This is how I chose my fursona bahaha
Thank you it was a fascinating watch
What??
I am going to present this video in my biology class. whish me luck <3
"If sex and gender are different, then why do some trans people get sex reassignment surgery, isn’t that then confirming to a gender binary where sex = gender?

Male clown fish can biologically turn into females.
"Female spiders, scorpions, mantises, pretty much anything from arthropoda or anything where the female is larger than the male comes to my mind...

Very fascinating video."
This video is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work and research !!
https://youtu.be/akFhYirNtfo
This is good... why so many dislikes?? transphobes???
"I asked myself this question (It's 4am lmao), because I couldn't sleep. So I googled and found this video ,thanks for the answer. ^^"
"I was debating this with a friend I brought the example of animals and nature to her. In nature (like you describe) there are species that change or adapt due to environment. Some even have sexual activity between the same sex but this ones don’t present any biological changes, it’s used to strengthen relationships. Humans don’t naturally change sex/gender. I’m more inclined to think that it’s a preference."
"Well this dosen't satisfy me.If you take the case of clownfishes they're biologically capable to change thier sexes,whereas that's not the case with humans.The real question is does our close relatives like chimpanzees be born as male/female and identify themselves with a different sex ?"
As soon as i clicked this video.... a free bible app shoved up out if no where....( NO IM NOT HOMOPHOBIC OR TRANSPHOBIC!! IM BI AND MY BFF IS TRANS FYI )
Wish I saw some huge ol cheetah clit dick tbh
Great video!
Contact Dr Oko for ex reuniting spell on his email: solutionhome@outlook.com . he restored my lost relationship back to me now I'm happy.
I was late to your lateness and hence am on time for you the following year!! (Bc u said u r late)
"Thank you for such great videos, Trace! You rock!"
1 of my friends is a transphobe and they said if an animal does it I'm ok with it so this video is very hands and I will show it to them. Thank you!
I'm confused. The examples given are of animals having physical characteristics of the opposite gender or of animals with hormone imbalances. How is that the same as feeling like another gender and transitioning?
Does anybody know where I can find that chart at 10:31?
video starts at 3:54
"And?
When we have the ability to do that im pretty sure we will still call us transgender"
"That is an evolutionary trait, humans don't have that."
it's not like they need to be bigger because they are full of eggs or anything.
He's wrong.
"Saw a video where a trans person actually called a specialist and said that the the part of the brain that generally work to determine masculine or feminine doesn't always align with the body. So outside no we don't change but internally our brains will have its own identity and it's a physical thing that doctors, scientists, and researcher can identify AND, according to the specialist, it happens as the fetus develops. So definately not preference. I don't like to be particularly anecdotal and im also not trans, but it's also not environmental either, my mom basically raised me like a boy, I don't even remember playing with barbies and dressed like a boy, yet I've never had gender dysphoria or anything like that. Because my brain didn't developed that way as I was gestating."
Glad you enjoyed it!
Animals also eat their young in a bunch of species. Maybe we should consider that too?
"cool, so it's ok for me to write about sneekyass cross dressers(see cuttlefish). good to know you guys love it."

"My dog is born male but he seemed to have a lot of stress... (we didn't know that though) we let the vet cut of his balls (English is not my first language) and he relaxed soooooo much ever since (he stopped chewing of thr hair of the other dogs and all that... he is more laid back and everything....
Maybe having testosterone in the body made him feel not himself....

(I'm ftm trans myself...)"
"In my school of around 300 people there are 4 people that are openly transgender (I’m one of them) but there are 5 others I know of that aren’t out, that’s 9 people! And that’s just for those that have been in counselling to discuss their options as transgender people, what if there are more people that just haven’t said a single thing to anyone and not even the council!"
Very good vid
I missed the days I used to watch you on DNews in Highschool. So glad I found your channel after all these years!
Yes and external sex is all you need to look at because it works for over six billion people to the very small amount of you people you are not going to win the argument ever give it up
I guess I have to say this to humans don't care about hyena dick this is the most hilarious and the sickest thing I've ever seen at the same time
"The Lioness is defective then she's a genetic fuck up, duh,  how hard is that to understand"
"Sorry, straight people don't think that way and they never will ,straight people will always put gender and sex together cuz that's the way it works, there's more of us than there are of you , quit making it look like that there's so many of you everybody should desire your type, nope not going to happen"
So why don't people just feel like a girl and let that be that - not going and chopping off body parts
"But all this is nature and natural to that animal, humans force ourselves, nature to do that which isn’t natural."
"I like the video but a few things: perhaps people call it an agenda and not natural when you have pride plastered everywhere in your description and even in your video. You said so yourself that it wasn't pride month anymore, but you chose this topic explicitly with this pride in mind. Which, I'm not going to say don't be proud (though I find taking pride in things we have no control over such as our sexuality or race/ethnicity to be silly), but the implications here are not subtle at all. You should be able to talk about something like this without having to present it through a political lens, and unfortunately that's typically how things of this nature get lumped in with. 

I mean, you can't start the video with an almost satirical greeting to the ever expanding acronym of LGBT, un-ironically use the term ""assigned"" when dealing with objective biological sex (which you make very clear is different from gender, so while you can't check chromosomes, it's still not an assignment, it's an observable fact whether you are male or female regardless of your gender later in life) and have as I said, not so subtle shout-out to pride while thinking this isn't political; your express intention seemed political rather than educational, which I take issue with. If you have something scientific to propose, there is zero reason it should be viewed through a political lens no matter how inherently political the topic or your own views. Science doesn't give a fuck, or at least it shouldn't.

That said, I also find it misleading to suggest that non-human animals have gender expression in the same way we do, when again, you make distinct purpose in defining that gender is a social creation. I really don't think lions see it the same way that we do, so why even call it such? Especially when they have no gender identity to therefore express. There also seems to be inherent evolutionary benefits to nearly all of these examples, where humans can simply not say the same thing. Transwomen don't take on that form for any evolutionary benefit the same way a hyena with a pseudo penis would, or the species of bird you mentioned; they do it for personal benefit. They feel misaligned with their biological sex and take measures to facilitate feeling more in line with their identified gender. Gender dysphoria is real and a tragic condition I'd not wish on my worst enemy, and helping these people feel better in their bodies and living the way they want is important, but that doesn't make it an evolutionary thing, or even a natural one. I think terms like ""natural"" and ""unnatural"", or even mental illness have been words tainted by the misuse of prior eras. 

If you think back to a time our societies were governed by theocrats, they would label things natural or unnatural, and see those with questionable social behaviors as ill based entirely on their very limited perspective. They misused the terms to be derogatory and dehumanize people, but that's really not their function. People with mental illness are no less people, and deserve no less respect. Trying to evade calling something an illness or a condition only hurts the person suffering because you give them the idea that what they are experiencing is completely normal or natural and unfortunately, nearly half of trans people killing themselves is anything but normal or natural. It's awful that this statistic is even that high. Calling things like this unnatural or an abnormality isn't or shouldn't be a dig at that person; it isn't something that defines them (or again, shouldn't be), it is just a singular aspect of their being that happens to be different. That's okay. Being trans is okay. Yet, we get into some murky territory when we aim to be so inclusive that we cease even defining them as trans. The phrase ""trans women are women"" comes to mind and is problematic for several reasons. If they were indeed women, we'd just call them women. They are trans women because they are transitioning from one gender to the other. They transition into becoming women; you aren't virtuous because you rob them of their agency to make change by just saying they are women. They are not women. That's fine though, they don't have to be. 

We set ourselves up in these socially constructed bubbles that are immovable. Nobody is willing to think or learn; thoughts and opinions are only accepted if they fit the specific narrative. Do you know what that sounds like? Merely the inverse of the example I mentioned before, about our societies being ruled by people with narrow-minded, conservative thinking. The difference now, is instead of narrow minded conservative beliefs based in theocracy, we have narrow minded progressive beliefs based in sociological principals or perhaps the lack-thereof. It isn't a better outcome, it's just the same with another coat of paint. People should be accepted for who they are, full stop. It's just we've found ourselves overcompensating, and over-correcting by fighting battles that don't need to be fought or have already been won. What is gained by trying to arbitrarily justify trans people in human culture by finding it in other animals when it's hardly even needed? You don't need to justify their existence in this natural sort of way, and if it is a mental disorder, then it's not necessarily one that needs to be cured, but it does need to be treated. Treat these people by helping them live the lives that fit their minds and perceptions of self. A cure isn't something that eliminates a problem, it solves a problem. Trans people living the way they want is a problem solved; cured. We just need to do it the right way, and bring down that staggering statistic of suicide. I just don't think we help anyone by lying to ourselves about the causes and effects of these kind of social issues."
This is a terrible argument for the point you're trying to make.
You don't know what animals think. I personally believe animals think n understand things the way we do.
Wonderful video! Thank you for creating this work! I will be keeping this video on hand for the unnecessary times I have to have a discussion with someone about their behavior.
Aren't the a animals that change sex AND gender not trans since their gender still matches their sex?

i’m transgander"
Love ya Trace for bringing such an eloquent explanation of this topic!
"Y’all just confused..don’t spread any further confusion on the internet please!, hermaphroditism does exist in for example earth worms..they’re neither male or female cause they’re both and just a hermaphrodite specie, but in other animals for example mammals it’s different.. a female cannot transform into a male but you can only see a masculine female in the physical appearance and on the social expression and on top all of this is still just a female with hormonal issues or Congenital deformities, hermaphroditism does not exist in mammals, congenital sex defects does not make a person hermaphrodite or intersex it only may make them infertile, there’s nothing called “gender” and “gender identity”..fuck gender roles they say yet you see so what’s called a trans-boy at the age of 10 because she likes playing with boys stuff and wearing boy clothes, and for whom is reading this thank you and have a nice day ^_^"

Thank You Trace. Thank you.
Great video Trace! Thanks for doing what you do.
"Frack yes! Awesome video!

You rocked it, Tr-Ace Ventura!!! Thanks for all your hard work brosqueeze!"
You mixed up your terms when talking about the lioness with the mane. That wasn’t an example of gender expression if gender expression is simply behavior. That would just be a physical characteristic that she had no control over. If the example had been of her exhibiting more male typical behavior it would have made sense.
Thank you!!!  🥰
"Its 2019 and people still hate on others. It sounds cliche but why can't we just get along? Why should anyone care how others live their life? And also, spotted hyenas with their psuodo penis are awesome! Although giving birth through them sounds more painful than birth through a vagina"
"Hi Trace, great video as usual. Thanks for making this video. Would Mmamoriri (the lioness) not be considered intersex? Since there is both male and female physical attributes? Biological and psychological gender is CONFUSING!!"
Your dog is trans 😂

"I can see that view. But there's definitely some 'seeing both sides' to that... For example, on one hand it would be nice to have a cool name that was pithy and covered all the bases, on the other this is more transparent and explicitly inclusive of lots of individual groups (meaning they can have their own goals but still be part of the overall movement)."
"While I completely agree with you that it sort of creates a community which I wouldn't necessarily want to be a part of personally - but still am by default - any exposure is good exposure when it comes to making us visible and normalizing that we're part of society. 
Of course I wish that every vocal bad apple was a vocal good apple instead, but let's not take away the fact that they are in fact vocal. Because that helps a lot in making our situation increasingly widespread and talked about."

"Gender expression is both behavior and appearance, and in this case her expression — both in behavior [mounting, roaring], and in appearance [mane] — didn’t match her sex."
" @TraceDominguez  Would you consider gender psychological (because it's technically biology according to definition and synonyms, and psychology is biology too)? Not including the confusing gender expression, identity, etc etc, just gender itself."
" @TraceDominguez  Manes are a thing the body develops without the individual animal choosing it to develop, so it's not gender expression..."
 @TraceDominguez   i am sure higher levels of testosterone don't have anything to do with it
I thought gender is social and cultural.  Now you say it's biological and social.  You can't have it both ways.
Thanks for watching!!
I don’t want to think about giving birth through a penis — pseudo or otherwise 😖
"good question! Intersex is a sex not a gender. I didn't mention it here because it's already pretty comicated stuff, I just didn't want to overwhelm. So if she was both with a penis and a vagina then she may be intersex, but she wasn't (to my knowledge)"
" @TraceDominguez  I read a few articles on her, and it does seem she has female reproductive anatomy, which does mean she is not intersex, but she is infertile. She is also not the first and only of her kind, and it is suspected that genetic drift within her area's populations may be causing this. It is therefore strange that it is both a regular occurrence and she is infertile, since it means it's a dead-end trait. So far, from what I've gathered, it is suspected in utero affects could've caused it, which may be an indication of greater environmental effects that could influence gender expression in animals. My bet is plastic pollution, the legacy of our species, but I am biased,so (as you would say) MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED!
In any case, thank you for adding to the complex discussion that is the nature of our being, and I look forward to watching what you have for us next Monday."
"​ @TraceDominguez  In humans at least, there are a variety of intersex conditions; None of them produce BOTH sexual organs. The most they do is ambiguate them.
Intersex conditions are sometimes noticeable in genitalia, which makes doctors do horrible child genitalia mutilation (unnecessary genitalia invasive surgery which is entirely arbitrary and aesthetic and can often times lead to complications, plus this is especially true because intersex people have a much higher chance of experiencing gender dysphoria because of the arbitrary and often incorrect gender assignment at birth.) These ""corrective"" surgeries are one of the things the intersex community fights against. Since they are invasive and are a disgusting attempt to make people fit the sex binary who simply do not, and are in any case genital mutilation.


However, this doesn't mean intersex people all have this; Some intersex conditions result in gynecomastia in overall more male-leaning bodies, sometimes this results in other things, like excess body hair on female-leaning bodies. Some are actually unnoticeable; For example, there are many genetic disorders which cause the SRY gene from the Y chromosome to break off and create X chromosomes that have that same gene - In this case, since the SRY gene is responsible for creating TDF (testis determining factor) it will cause masculinization of a genetically female embryo and create what is essentially a completely male embryo besides its' genes. There are many such disorders for both males and females; You might even be intersex and not know it. It is estimated that 1 in 60 people have some intersex condition as far as I'm aware.


In the case of the lioness, it might be considered intersex if it has both physical attributes; However, if it has behavioural patterns of males (lions) then it might be reasonably considered transgender."
some thought maybe se has polycystic overysyndrome
 @TraceDominguez  there are more than that for intersex conditions
"Genesis 1:27-28-  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth. AND Mark 10: 6-9 =  But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.


7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and join to his wife;


8 And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.


9 What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
but what is outside of it, is not of God."
"I HAVE RECEIVED MY ANSWER. I used to think of this question a lot when I was younger. Wondering if animals can be trans. Tbh, I think animals aren't as dumb or as simple as we think they are. Thank you for this and keep up the hard work!"
Love the video. What is the name of your podcast? Does it have the same stuff from your video but in podcast or are they on a different topic?
"Trace, 
Even though I don't give a shit about what other people do so I don't give a shit about transgender people (it's a good thing because I am not against them until it affects me or my family in any way), your examples are laughable at best.
A lioness with a mane is more of an intersex than a transgender. She is closer to the South African runner than to Catlyn Jenner. Which makes it a bad example.
As for clown fish, it's a quirk of their biology, not their choice. Listen to your own words, WHEN THE LEADING FEMALE DIES, which means that there is a direct cause to the transition that comes from their BIOLOGY.
As for hyenas, you have got to be kidding me. EVERY hyena female has a pseudo penis, which makes it a shitty fucking example for transgenderism in the animal kingdom! They developed it in order to dominate the males because they have a female dominated society, not because they chose to develop it or grow it, or change themselves.

You are bending science to align with your political beliefs which is not something I signed up for. The above 3 examples make me question if I need to stay subscribed to you, because this isn't a science channel anymore."
"5:00 A transgender lion? Would she celebrate... pride pride?
Great video Trace! I have a biology degree and can confirm that nothing in nature is black and white. (except zebras, pandas etc.)"
"This was an incredibly complex and 
fascinating video! I identify as a cis 
gay man and I have often wondered 
what the role of all these wonderful 
letters is in our society, I mean we 
can’t just be accidental it’s gotta 
somehow be tied to evolution if 
we just continue to be born… right?"
"It's natural, sure, but I wouldn't say ""normal"". I mean statistically speaking it is very uncommon, far from being a normality. I don't have anything against trans people though. I'm just annoyed at how much controversy whe word ""normal"" causes even though it's just a math word, not some insulting classist word."
Well put. :-)
"I knew some of this stuff already, but not all of it.  The new info was pretty fascinating.
Also - pretty smart to have called out the haters right at the very beginning.  Even if you don't like/accept that there are transgenders (or multiple genders), the fact of the matter is gender is not the same thing as sex, and it's weird to me how people so adamantly argue against that.  It isn't a matter of opinion or political debate, and yet, people make it out to be anyway."
"I know 3 people who are transgender. (One of which is (now) my sister).
And I like how this makes our family just a bit more special ^^"
so would it be valid to call someone who used to be slim but became fat later 'transfat' ?
"funny enough, gender has at times also referred to different bloodlines and families"
"Definitely loved this video! Even though I accept transgender people as normal, I always wondered if there were transgender tendencies in other animals that would prove humans are not alone, and wondered if it had anything to do with how the brain works. Really interesting, keep it up!"
How would this work with self replicating cretures or cretures that can reproduce both with a mate and by themselves?
This is a great explanation and really gets the point across. But I know for a fact that pseudopenis will be what I'll tell everyone about :D
10/10 Trace. Fantastic video.
"This is a fascinating area of study. The more we look at the categories we've created, the more clear it is that nature is not easily categorized."
"In Spanish, the gender of a word is usually determined by the last vovel in a word. The vowel ""O "" is usually associated with masculinity and  the vowel""A"" is reserved for femininity. 

Oddly though, the word for Television (la television) is feminine while a TV set (el televisor) is masculine, go figure."
Great video and interesting topic. I hope the comments won't be that bad.
"are selfsexuals classified  under the A or the I? 
I feel like i have to study to decode LGBTQIA+ abbreviations, it changes as fast as the people in it, i'm asking so i can explain it to the old lady next door. she thinks anyone who cant find a partner that fit together mechanically and have kids is gay, even people who choose to be single."
"This is a great parable of the creation of humanity, but it didn’t happen overnight. It happened over millions and millions of years of slow, painstaking evolution. Evolution is messy, so things don’t always work out to be ‘this or that’ and instead are more shades of grey."
" @TraceDominguez  it's a matter of believing, I believe that God created everything there is, you believe that one day absolute nothing exploded and everything appeared, it is a position of faith, not of science."
"And a position of faith is inherently personal, so don't assume everyone shares your beliefs."
The reciprocal is also true.
Science on animal thinking is soooo primitive still. We have no solid way to test their cognition! Maybe someday we will get better... Maybe you can come up with new tests!
"Animals can't trans, they dont understand things like gender"
But he's giving examples of animals that CAN change on their own bc they have the capabilities of doing so. It's not the same as trans humans. Terrible examples.
"The podcast is called Science Plus (it went through a number of names over the years, don't get me started 🙄) and you can find it on YouTube!!"
"Thanks for your comment! TBH it sounds like you do give a shit about transgender people here, or at least that you think the existence of the trans community is a political issue. (let me know if I'm off base here). 

I did think about all these things and mentioned in the video that these are not 1:1 comparisons, and that we have a more complex social and cognitive system at play than an animal. The point being animals can have a gender expression that doesnt match their birth sex, and that is (at it's most simple) what transgender means as well.

But I want to correct one thing: Intersex is a sex issue not a gender expression. Someone born with both male and female parts, or with no discernable external difference in sex organs would be intersex, that isn't the case with Mmamoriri to my knowledge. She is sexed as a female, but looks and behaves like a male. We cannot know what she feels in her brain, so we don’t know her identity, but her expression is more male than other lionesses — thus she has been labeled (by many outlets and publications, not just by me) as trans."

"Taking it out of the DSM is also bad for science and society in general. A disorder is an excursion from the norm, an abnormality. Just because there are millions of others with the same abnormality, doesn't make it normal; it's an order of magnitude away from the billions of 'normal' people. And if, generally speaking, you need hormone supplements and surgery for your internal and external gender identity to align, that puts it squarely in medical territory. Such a shame that politics get in the way of science and medicine."
"Completely agree. Also cancer is much more common, but that doesn't mean we should say it's normal either. Normal doesn't mean good, it means common."
"I guess it depends on your definition of normal v abnormal. It's true that statistically ian abnormality if you assume there are only a handful of major groups and minor outgroups, but the reality is quite different. No one is 100% straight or gay, nor is anyone 100% one gender -- meaning overall, accepting it as normal is to accept it as part of the natural variation of human sexuality. When you look at transgenderism as a small variation in the human socio-sexual experience, it's extremely normal to have variation. To touch on Jackson's example, cancer is a normal part of the human experience, as 0.4% of humans will get it. While its incidence is low, it is absolutely a normal (or common) human affliction. If you accept the premise that cancer is abnormal cell growth which happens commonly enough to be considered a normal affliction -- then transgender,  with an estimated incidence of around 0.4% in the US -- would also be a normal (or common) part of humanity."
"Our use and conceptualisations of words like 'normal' and 'abnormal' DO have a kind of subjective meaning to them. I have never heard anyway say ginger haired people are 'abnormal', yet people say it very often about intersex people, despite both being nearly equally as common. Statistics are a thing of course, but let's not ignore how words are used in multiple ways, sometimes not only having an ""objective"" meaning but at the same time an insulting classist use, and how these kinds of things can have an impact on marginalised people's well-beings, so that it might be better to avoid saying intersex and trans people are ""abnormal"""
"It’s really tough to have a worldview challenged, and people don’t always listen to facts. It’s better to be calm and collected and politely discuss the issues, chipping away at the ideas until you get to why people feel they way they do! (Often with LGBTQIA+ it comes down to, either ‘it’s icky’ or ‘why do they get special treatment, I’m special too!’)"
"Aisling Transphobic? Just know nothing will stop the LGBTQ+ Community from showing pride! I’m proud to say that I’m pansexual and non-binary, you can sit here and argue with me if you’d like but you won’t block my pride at all!"
"The meaning might work, but it would be really uncouth."

there aren't. these people are grasping at straws. these are the same kind who think if their male dog licks their male cat's face they are in an interspecies homosexual relationship.
Wonder no more! There aren't.
"There aren't, and trans people are man made, a social construct."
"You mean creatures that reproduce asexually? That’s an interesting question! I’m not an expert, but asexual reproduction isn’t common in higher animals, so those that DO reproduce in this way probably don’t have as defined gender expression, therefore, it might not really apply, but honestly I have no idea!"

" @romanjancura9651  But remember, all the categories are created, even the ones we think of as 'natural.' Simple or binary categories are still human concepts, not biological 'facts.'"
"Yeah spanish is full of things like that. Like if you say the area ""el área"" masculine, but if you say all this area ""toda esta área"" feminine"
LANGUAGE IS SO CRAZY COOL
" @danilotorres2425  Actually 'el área' is still feminine, it's just that 'la area' sucks to pronounce, so they just go with 'el area'. If you add an adjective to 'el area', it still has to end in an 'a', not an 'o'. I think all feminine words that start with an 'a' get stuck with 'el' instead of 'la'."
" @ryn2844  Then how about words like ""el futbolista"" o ""el periodista"" are they masculine or feminine?"
" @danilotorres2425  That depends on the gender of the person you are referring to with those words :)
If you are talking about a female journalist or soccer player, it turns into 'la periodista' and 'la futbolista.'
Those two words just happen to end in an 'a' regardless of the gender of the person you are referring to."

Oh I’m sure they will be 🥳
What do you mean by selfsexual? Something on the asexual spectrum? Though someone who doesn't feel attraction to others would be aromantic. Those two would fall under the A.
"A is asexual, I is intersex (I.e.: people whose sex is not clearly female or male, previously and pejoratively known as hermaphrodites) So, I'd say people who want to be single and not have any kind of intercourse are asexual. Maybe not stereotypically asexual, but at least a part of the grey spectrum (technical name for the spectrum of intensity of sexual attraction from completely sexual and romantic and esthetically motivated and socially to someone who completely rejects anyone, passing through the indifferent ones and the conditioned ones.)
If you want to be overly pedantic, you could say that what most people think of as one phenomenon is actually a whole set: sex, gender, sexuality, sensuality, romanticism and aesthetics. And each one can be completely independent of one another and be signaling to different people or towards no one at all. An example could be a female (sex) whose social role is that of a man (gender) who has never been in love and doubts he will be (aromantic) but likes having sex with men (homosexual since sexuality is defined from gender) but likes being cuddled and kissed by women (heterosensual) and finds everyone good looking, including people with ambiguous looks (panaesthetic). If he only liked men and women, but not the in between, he would be biaesthetic. 
But that last paragraph is maybe too much for talking with the old lady nextdoor.

EDIT: phrasing of intersex explanation."
" @somedragontoslay2579  I'm not intersex but I do know that 'hermaphrodite' is not used of human beings and is considered offensive. Other than that, we're mostly in agreement. One thing that I would mention is that asexual specifically refers to the lack of sexual attraction to others (depending on whom you ask, the definition may also include a lack of sex drive).


I'm trans, nonbinary, grey-biromantic, and grey-bisexual (more or less, I think -- let's not go into microlabels rn -- my being neurodivergent complicates things)."
" @SuviTuuliAllan  Indeed, it's offensive. That's why I only use it at the end, not like the main word. But I have to reckon older terminology in order to be didactic. I admit I could have phrased it better. Editing asap."
"@UCvrqcPYs5KgRIlAhZHvGw_A wow, that's a mouthful. 
Thank you, based on your explanation i've come to realize that i'm as outdated and under a rock as much as that stubborn old lady next door, my rock is just wee bit smaller. 
""panaesthetic"" haha i didnt even know there was a word for this😅"
" @SuviTuuliAllan  By the way, you're right: I forgot sex drive versus sexuality. So, for the sake of completeness, I'll expand my explanation: Sex drive is the hormone coctel and sexuality is that coctel being conditioned by a particular set of people. One can have sex drive without it being conditioned by the presence or thought about anyone and  that would be called libidic asexuality or one can have no coctel at all and that would be alibidic asexuality. Maybe that's what the OP calls selfsexuality? Libidic asexuality?"
autosexual is GRSM
"Thank you for this video, it's really interesting to think about how animals who perform different roles relative to their assigned sex experience life... as a trans girl myself I sometimes find myself wondering how things would be for me if I was instead a rabbit or guinea pig or cat or flamingo or hippo... etc... would I still be trans? Would social transition work out? It's not really a thought process that goes anywhere but it's something I think about occasionally."
Well there's furries so idk how that wasn't figured out already

"No no...this will not be the place to be today, this comment section is going to war."

I think gender and sex are different but alot of people think sex is invalid and everything is a social construct. I think sex does effect our gender expression but society also does. I really enjoyed this video interesting topic.
"¿Donde esta la biblioteca, Trace?"
The answer to that is yes because transgender flat-earthers exist.

"It is invalid only in the sense that 1) it is like the concept of species (which isn't as straightforward or easily explained as many think) and 2) our cultural ideas of gender colour our ideas of sex, which is also partly why (or some sort of justification for) westerners have imposed our own ideas on indigenous peoples (not all cultures have a gender binary). That's just my take on it as a white nonbinary trans woman. You might want to talk to intersex people, though. Some people see it as a disease (DSD) and many others as natural variation."
" @SuviTuuliAllan  If you are open to discussion, I would like to ask you something considering you are none binary. I understand the transgender argument, but I never understood the none binary argument even though I respect and support them. But if your sex is female but you do not identify with the social construct of what a woman is, arent you just a woman who does not identify with the social construct of what a woman is? why do you have to be another gender?"

" @TraceDominguez  OMG, the Great Trace Dominguez! Love your videos."
"Funnily enough those same people are the ones who invoked the natural fallacy in the first place as a means to attack trans people's existence, so whenever someone gets mad at transness being natural their offense is hypocritical."
"Animals changing ""gender"" is not the same phenomenon observed in humans so one doesn't validate the other. Animals don’t experience gender dysphoria, they don't have concepts of gender. Their ability to change their sex qualities has nothing to do with feeling a certain way; it has to do with species survival.  Humans cannot change their biological sex qualities like some animal species can.

The animal phenomenon is biological whereas the human phenomenon is psychological based, affected  or influenced by societal constructs of gender"

FHRITP.com
"should have titled this fuck  her right in the pussy comp, thought this video was gonna be something actually worth wasting my time on"
The irony is the fuck her right in the pussy guy was fake but caused real trolling though
They should think of their own phrases
fuck right in the pussy
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Those are the heroes of our generation.
Not all trolls are bad
1:42 and 3:27 are definitely the best ones
So many FHRITP XDD
I like the part where that guy said fuck her right in the pussy.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?!
"I'm an Internet troll! I'm still learninf, though. This is BOOTOFUL!!1!2!1!!1 This is what we need, forget America, forget Congress .

That was a rude lady.
6:03
I hate when people do this. It's actually not funny and also is disrespectful for people if they have something tragic going on.
Lost it when they said “that was a weird lady”
i think this is the funniest video on youtube ever!!!
good video but which body part of the girl should i fuck
3:27 now that's awkward
The one at 1:43 was the best
",,it is a no refusal weekend'' dead"
Together we unite.
the one at 4:05 is GREAT perfect
"how come the background building at 0:15 looks just like the one shown at the intro of ""Ultimate Surrender"" & ""Fucking Machines"" videos on Pornhub?"
And they say white people have no culture.
This is way too funny
A good fuck in the pussy should fix all that
"""I hate when people do this. It's actually not funny and also is disrespectful for people if they have something tragic going on."" 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓"

Are you Sri Lankan?
It's so beautiful because it perfectly illustrates just how archaic the mainstream media is compared to our current culture and values.  No one cares if you say fhritp except these scripted robots on the news.  It makes the news feel so much more cold and distant.
3:00
2:08 when you think you get attacked
I HAD NO CLUE SO MANY PEOPLE HAS DONE THIS! HOW GREAT! I have a new bucket list goal
This is world ☮️
"""Pousseeey"" oh the British accent."

They trying not to laugh.
"It shows peoples subconscious hatred and rejection of the zionist media . Now stage 2 is to truth bomb them with exposing their lies , live on camera . Constant smoke and mirrors from the 6 companies that control ALL media . Wake up America ."
Omg its the Boston hoax cowboy hat man. Fuck that guy .
0:52 her eyes are creepy but it is a alien theory 🤔
When a meme unites. Would’ve been funny if they set that up so when the camera turns if points at a huge sign saying what he said 4:05

6:05 Instant justice right there!
i would like but i see you already have 420 likes
That's assault. I hope the pussy preacher sued the old reporter.
It's an assault caught on camera bro. No matter how much you try and jazz it up - It's assault! If you raise your hands to anyone first it's assualt.
LOL!
"Smug caucasoid- Doesent matter.The pussy preacher has got to report it to the cops first.And I dont think he will get anywhere in court,though, considering the reporter, and the news organisation he works for, would have a whole load of highly paid attorneys to back him up."
"No,not really,King Mitchy.But its probably not a good idea to say it on live TV."
Dan Whitmore He got hit with that old man strength too.
"I dunno, he looked like he could of really smacked him one,but I dont think the old git wanted to kill him or break his nose,,just  get him outta way. Besides,the reporter was on live TV, so he couldn't do much damage to the guy anyway."
"He got hit because he didn't say the word ""right""."
Smug caucasoid you're a fucking idiot
"@Bob Gorilla You call this justice, yet if somebody took something you did to entertain everyone and punched you such aggressively for it, for simply disagreeing with you and being unable to SAY it rather than punch you like a kid freaking out, you'd call this a problem. But let me expose it to you, he's a grown man, with enough force to kill someone if he hit a bad spot, thus why it is 100% illegal and unreasonable whatever the situation, and thus why we instantly see a threat to man rasing hand on a women, the fact you're asking to be reminded those basic matter and laugh to those who doesn't succesfully remind them to you, simply show you're enjoying more to see people suffer if you think the cause is right than to help them getting right. But here's the thing, us, normal people, don't want to see you getting beaten off to learn it or respect, we're here telling you about it, so stop acting like an entitled boomer. You're the exact kind of person to wish to all those in prison to get violated then call it ""justice"" again, yet not acknowledging it doesn't happen because it would be made by other prisonners, and you know what? In reality, the whole prison system isn't made of rapers, and doesn't transform them into one to contaminate each newcomer, we're talking about actual PEOPLE with BRAINS, not zombies needing punishment. Same here, just because he's joking doesn't allow anyone to become a violent fuck. What a sick way to see things."

Awesome video bro saw your comment on hip hop madness
Nice mv

Much love from Reddit! You got that great flow bro! I'm truly interested to see where your channel goes man all the best to you! You ever want to make a song for eye intro will pay you LOL
Catchy!
This is dope bro!
An amazing music video my friend!
"Appreciate you, don't forget to share."
" @MaxFortuneMusic  No problem, I'm looking forward to the music you'll make."
Appreciate it
 @vintagedocs1282  if that's all your brain could generate maybe you don't get anything more sophisticated? Just a thought.
" @vintagedocs1282  how does someone whose vocabulary involves lots of little yellow smiley faces call anyone an idiot? 

Some people are so far behind in the race they think they're first. Think about that dipshit."
 @RMGWOO  lol he says all black people sell crack and they should die by a hole in the head but he loves black artist funny how those type of people work huh. Just ignore him he's not the first and won't be the last they all listen to me trying to convince themselves I'm bad. Thanks for having my back bro.
 @RMGWOO  btw idk if you checked I dropped a new song called Man of the Year my fans really like that one in case you're looking for new music
" @MaxFortuneMusic  not liking someone's art and telling them you don't like it are two different things. The former is just taste, the latter is contempt. They envy freely creative people and cope with that envy with false superiority. Pathetic."
 @MaxFortuneMusic  Will check that out.
 @RMGWOO  everything you said is exactly why he hates black people tho lol but his biggest music idols are black you can actually see him insinuate my dad sells crack and all and you heard him tell you what real music is 😂😂 I bet you 3 years from now he deletes all these comments and starts praising me while still being racist mark my words
 @RMGWOO  he got mad cause I said if he was really in control of America he wouldn't work a 9-5 lol idk why that triggered him this much but yet he thinks he's superior to me and his favorite artist 😂😂
" @MaxFortuneMusic  I believe it. Him calling someone else stupid is like a clown making fun of someone's shoes. 

And that's the most cowardly kind of racism, too. At least you can say some people put some thought into their prejudices. Specimens like this are only armed with insulting remarks based on media stereotypes of their target race group. That shows it's all a facade with inadequacy beneath."
 @RMGWOO  lol you basically gave him the same response I did. I don't understand how people still believe in archiac lies.
Vintage DOCS you hatin bcuz you can’t do what he does
 @damu2482  lmao nah he's just a racist I exposed on a video and he got mad and started spamming my youtube
Good things come to those who wait.
See you in 2 years 😂😂
🙏🙏
Thanks JoJo
"Awww, I love coconut pie"
Tanks
girllllll
Thanks if you can find a beat I'd be happy to do it for cheap
 @MaxFortuneMusic  sickness! I'll lyk in a week or 2!

Thank you I appreciate it

"Damn bruh lyrically you're up there with J.I.D, SABA and Mick Jenkins"
"""Max not Cole, still can be your therapist"" Only real J Cole fans know how mind blowing that line is."

Thanks means alot
Thank you. I can use all the subs I can get.

"I'm trying to make just that happen. Most of the beats I use are Lo-Fi, have a whole Lo-Fi project coming up but I have to put in the work to get people to notice me and recognize me. I appreciate the feedback."
" @MaxFortuneMusic  Only a pleasure, man. Can't wait to hear the new projects. I sent you a DM on Instagram. When you have the chance, could you take a look at it please?"
That was my last IG I updated the description DM me there
Hey thanks I appreciate you even mentioning me in the same sentence with those legends
You onto something

If only Minecraft Earth actually worked like this... where there is CREATIVE mode
"people: WE NEED MINECRAFT EARTH FASTTT

mojang: pls be patient we work so hard 24/7 and our teams dont sleep...

SethBling makes minecraft earth with armor stands: welcome back sethbling here."

2. How to manage the inventory? I get so many different blocks and chests don't work on the build plate.
3. Could you add collectable mobs to the game? 

4. Can you make a skyblock world with datapack or is there already one?"

The tappables on minecraft earth are way too overpowered
"interesting concept, can i store items in a chest on the build plate and move it somewhere else, and when i plop it down open the chest to grab those items. And also, can you have more than one of your build plates active at once? Like so i can make a large portable black market."

I feel like I just watched a real-life cartoon
I’m a born and raised NYer living in Brooklyn. I try so hard to NOT take the train for the past few years and I try to stay in my Borough. But after watching this video shows me what Ive been missing. That 96/second ave station is is new. Looks so nice. When I worked at Metropolitan Hospital in 2005-7 it wasn’t there and I had to take that long walk from Lexington ave to second ave. I hated it. It’s nice to see how beautiful it is and that walk is a short walk to the Hospital. Thanks. I need to get out more. ❤
Indian man show d slums of India lol
I don't have a favorite subway station bur if I have to pick which one is the best I'd say either Fulton Street - Oculus or 34th Street Hudson Yards
One of my friends and his wife are one of the mosaics at 72nd!   They were done by Brazilian artist Vik Muniz.
I like the World Trade Center cortland 1 line.
Came here after watching the WORST Subway in New York vlog :)
I guess it's because all the Republicans left.
The pedalus make more money that a people who works hard for their living I stopped giving money besides I don't have it
Go to 42nd and Time Square what station smells urine everywhere Uptown Westside some subway stations are in chaos especially 190 number one train or the A train stations😡😧
Why it looks so nice because people cares for where they live and those people are very active and constantly complaining about bad things which is very good😍 I have been in 72nd and 2nd Avenue 86th and secondary stations are beautiful super clean the people are nice😍 keep up the good job people don't take any nonsense allowing people to destroy your neighborhoods and take care and protect the law enforcement they are the one that keep us safe

"Westfield World Trade Center is a shopping mall at the World Trade Center complex in Manhattan, New York, that is operated and managed by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. The mall opened on August 16, 2016 as the largest shopping complex in Manhattan, with 125 retail spaces. It replaces the Mall at the World Trade Center, the underground shopping mall under the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001."
Fulton street is really nice! Love shopping and is super easy and convenient in general.
"Born and Bred, plus 30 yrs. NYCTA conductor. I remember when many stations had shopping. The new Independent Subway, built mostly between 1930-1936 had shops in every major station, especially in Queens. Barber and shoe repair, music and clothing. Vending machines galore. Cigarettes? Couldn't smoke'em, but you could buy'em. Last,   the penny dispenser of a tiny 2pk of Chiclets gum, neatly tucked into the center of the painted station girders. I grew up around 14st/8ave., fond memories."
"Anything you want to know about old NYC, let me know. Already subscribe to Urban Caffeine and Brighttrip."

Quaint patio with rocking chairs, pretty houses and lots of trees."
"See below the subway system of a medium size city in China ,  from the eyes of an Italian girl ,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRakp93YUk"
My Favorite subway station is The World Trade Center Station
I'm will go to in New York.
"In comparison to places like Singapore(where I live) or Japan or Korea, the NYC subway's best stations look like the walmart version LMAO"
two years later & i still see those guys on the C train singing 😭
I think the hats in the 23rd st. station are a reference to the famous windy corner of the Flatiron 23rd & Bdwy. Funny. I never noticed them before.
what was the song in the beginning?
Will spend Station end up on the list once renovations are complete?
"I was hoping that you'd note that the Q train and it's 96th St. end of line is the (recently) brand new and much over delayed and still incomplete 2nd Avenue subway. Also, if memory (we won't rely on it) serves me correctly, the only two subway lines that actually have a directional loop (south to north) are the #1 & #6 whereas all of the other lines in both the A-Division (IRT) and B-Division (BMT/IND) are end to end/point to point. Again, superb video!"
"The guys singing on the train would absolutely horrify commuters on the London Underground, but we'd just pretend they weren't there and awkwardly wish for them to leave and have a mini anxiety attack the whole time but not actually do anything about it."
I miss my home town new York where I was mostly raised all my life...
"Lol go to Japan’s subway  train Station such as Tokyo Kyoto Osaka and so on and you will see you are in another world subway train station they have a bunch of different types of restaurants shops, bars  etc. At the Subway train station in Japan it’s totally huge chances are you will get lost lol."
"Even the best NY subway stations are nowhere near the quality of London, Paris or Moscow stations."
"In DC we have people playing live GoGo music on the trains using plastic buckets for money on the trains.  If you don't know what GoGo here's one example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqL_QoRM3Co"
"Your catches of the different subway stations and lines are eye-catching. My first favorite subway station is Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center. It is under Flatbush Avenue. Long time ago, the uptown platform of the 2 and 3 trains had tall fences along the platform, separating it from the Long Island Railroad station. Today, the steel gratings were replaced with glass bricks. The station has some elevators and a couple of ramps. You may be interested in the Sutphin Boulevard and Jamaica Center stations under Archer Avenue. Even the Jamaica-Van Wyck Boulevard station of the E line may pique your interests. For a nice and old station, see the 49 Street Station. If you go to Brooklyn, see the Stillwell Avenue-Coney Island Station. By the way, I am a railroad or subway buff."
"When you say 23rd Street Station here in N.Y.C. you have to say which 23rd Street station. There are several of them. Also, how ironic is it that staying on the southbound #6 train to see the old City Hall Station & the train turnaround at Brooklyn Bridge as one of the ""Best"" is connected to one of the ""Worst"", Chambers Street on the ""J/Z"" since the 2 stations are a connected transfer point."
I'd prefer having people singing instead of begging
What are they even singing? 😂
Washer_b i have no idea but definitely old songs
I love those guys
"One of my favs is Columbus circle 59th. They have tons of restaurants and candy places. Very colorful and fun station.

Edit: I saw this was already a comment didn’t mean to copy it."
The oculus is the second best station imo behind New York Penn Station.
SSS three shuttles
The Queens 96st  station looks A LOT
I love Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station!
That first station did look like a classic London Underground station. Good job on these ones MTA
Man it really comes to show how some of the most Godsend Stations are in Central and Lower manhattan
Man I used to be a train fanatic when I was little and I went back for nostalgia a few days ago and now I think it's coming back lol. My favorite station is definitely the 34th Street one next to Madison Square Garden with all the stores and you could transfer to the NJ Transit which is Penn Station if I'm not mistaking.
4:35 R179 Lemon 🍋
6:09
Visit the grand central terminal
"MTA ""we love you all"" but you ain't getting nice seating in your train..!!"
I like the WTC-Cortland on the 1. You see the messages there
What is train mph?
Fulton street the best station
"The 2nd Ave Q Line station are basically brand new, they opened in 2016."
"Well, .... it's the BEST? .... man, sorry.... go to Moscow...."
I like the 8th Ave line 14 st station with the little figures all over the place.
And also when I used to live in NYC I loved riding the Subway Trains 🚉 over 🌉 Bridges too their fascinating!!!
I really like 96th street 🚉 Q train station and the 34th street Hudson on No.7 line and you show great subway station videos on YouTube keep on showing them.
Like The New LA stations ie Pershing Square station among others. So...you copy! 😎
"after recently moving out of NYC to Boston, I don't think that I'll ever see a nicer station then the Oculus."
"what he cools an ""absolutely cool and modern subway station"" is equal to an illegally dirty station in Germany xD"
"NY needs newer metro trains, brighter lighting and better flooring it's so dirty."
"Any station in Warsaw, Poland is better than the vast majority of NYC stations lol"
see the 4 train
"Yes, I love the Oculus."
"You did some great stations, but what happened to the 167th in the BRonx!!!!"
Hudson 👌🏿 .... 22 Nov B Bck At 7 Train Queens Jackson Heights
The newer stations remind of me of DC and LA subway stations.
WTC Cortlandt and South Ferry on the 1...
Wish you also showed the station that you can’t stop at in the B or D line one of those lines and the station is covered in art and when the train passes by it looks like a movie as you look at the art while moving
YOU HAVE NO FEAR ON THE LEMON C TRAIN
"More cities should copy Tokyo and turn their stations into vibrant happening spots with cafes, restaurants, stores and whatnot."
The World Trade Center 1 stop is amazing. It’s so clean and temperature controlled.
"I remember travelling to NY and stopping by the Oculus Building before it was built. Not many people were there, and it was very cool being inside while it is quiet."
All before COVID
Great video!.    https://youtu.be/VJbkaHNy8Pg
"Grand central buddy, where is it"
"No offense but all of those stations are really dull... Some colourful hexagons or some fake skeletons won't change the character of the whole station... Also the trains look really old...
You said that some of those stations were built to mimic european styled subway stations... From what I know, Moskow has the best subway stations. They were made as ""palaces for the people""... As for the trains, in Romania you can find more beautiful and probably more silent trains than in New York...
In my personal opinion subway sistems can have truly magnificent architecture but everywhere around the world, they are made cheaply. The stations in New York are sadly no exception from the rule mentioned above..."
Not as cool as Parisian stations though!
I love the NYC subway from Times Square  to Harlem. Look forward to riding it soon.
Have you ever been to the Stations in London? They are beautifull
"Rest of the world (esp Asians) be like, you call these nice stations?"
"NYC subway system is one big poop.  It's confusing and dirty and they say it is a world class city... 
I hope you get to travel the world. 
This video made me go take a shower."
"If got a dollar for ever NYC subway perform I saw I would have....
About 200 dollars"
funny thing is ive probably gone on all of those trains
I live like a couple blocks away from 96 street
HEXAGONAL thanks.
I LOVE NEW ♥ YORK
"Gee,,the floor is dirty and gross tbh."
"148th st in harlem, 3 train. 
its a nice station. kinda ugly but i love it"
fun fact Hudson yards station used to have a model of the new R211 trains
World Trade Center is a mall with a subway station in it.

"23rd street and where?  There are 5 stations at 23rd street. :-)

And ""The Hive"" was named so because the octagonal panels were designed to look like honeycomb."
All white people

Nice stations
The most unique I think (not nicest) is Jamaica-Van Wyck. Especially back in the 80's when the skylights were open and the daylight used to shine down.
points at hexagon Its octogonal
"Record Mart is a record store (as the name suggests). One of the better stores in Ny. They do not sell comic books, only vinyl records,  CD’s, headphones, etc. Permanently closed due to Covid after 72 years"
Those Q stations are still pretty much brand new including Hudson Yards on. Museum of Natural History station is phenomenal Times Sq not pretty but. Huge and. Varied
"Those are so clean! Only problem is...





platform edge doors"
"Coney Island, the roof is like a station in Europe, but instead of being glass, it’s solar panels (would be great if someone invented transparent solar panels some day."
"Fulton is my favorite, I used to hang out in the Fulton center (nicknamed the food court) with my friend between classes at Bmcc. Or go shopping at the oculus."
"So the 81 Street / Museum of Natural History Station is like Duvbo, a metro station in Stockholm."
Wow São Paulo's subway ia by the way too much better.
Coney Island station is also pretty cool in my opinion
You didn't even mention the name of the architect of the Oculus! :( Santiago Calatrava!  He's the only famous architect I know of to have designed a subway station in New York.
should have seen the exclusive r211 train model at Hudson heard 34th street :)
"That lighting art in the Bleecker station is not octagonal, it's hexagonal - just 6 sides, not 8."
you must have low standards....
That Looks Cool

"I remember that on the 6 line, 68th St-Hunter College has a window above the tracks so you can look at oncoming trains and the tunnels. I loved it when I was a kid."
Chambers station seeing this like 👁👄👁
"I dont think New Yorkers realize that you guys are basically speaking Chinese to us when talking about your sub lines, platforms, terminals etc. The majority of us cities don't have more than 5 sub lines where im from only has one metro subway line lol. I took the sub in NYC before but thankfully my friends knew where they were because I was lost."
"Does Grand Central Terminal count as a subway station it’s like the home of metro north but the 4,5,6,7 and S trains stop there"
That whole station at The American Musuem of Natural History as far as I saw with my own eyes was out togther by a lady with army clothing on. I work there at the Musuem and The Rose Center for Earth and Space aka The Hayden Planetarium as securty a guard for about 27 years.  I remember when she was working on it constantly.
Hudson yards is overrated!!!!
A year before LOCKDOWN
NOW YOUR FOLLOWING THE MONEY SON
I want to go to New York :[
when you were going to hudson yards from time square why is the there a flashing green signal what does that mean?
Include WTC cortlandt
"I came to visit NYC 3 years ago and never left. And the subways, both good and bad are fascinating to me."
"South Korea, Japan and China are more developed than Europe and Europe is more developed than the United States."
"Sorry, but still dirty to me. Even on new Hudson Yards station you can see leaks, and dirt in corners everywhere."
🤣 so true
"DUDE! I'm not trying to stare at yr face the whole time i wanna see what you went to see, not hatin but one can only stare at a face for so long. So can you do one on the Hudson Yards area? It sounds like its finished? and if so can you do one [if its now fully completed]  on the new sky-way, the old [eastside?] elevated train line that leads to Hudson Yards? And my understanding is that the rail depot is still there, they just built the entire development on top of it?
And finally whats the progress on this so-called infamous East line? why is it taking so long? even London finally finished there gigantic train line tunnel project, which took forever, i hear this NYC East line has been in the works since the 70's??!! is this true??!! dammit NY get yr fuckin shit together!! (I'm being a hypocrite tho, being a LA resident as i am....FUCK i wish i had had the chance to see the WTC twin towers"
"I haven't seen anyone talk about how good those people could sing, I am disappointed"
"Some of the best trains too
First Q train: R160A
Second Q train: R160B
C trains: R179
7 train: R188
6 train: R62A"
It’s nice information. On my next day off I wanna visit 96 st subway station. You are doing good job keep it up buddy. 😊
"Bom  video, mas eu ainda prefiro as de São Paulo, Brasil,  aqui os ratos não são tão comuns quanto os desenhos dos Simpsons mostravam , nice"
No Barclays center or Columbus Circle?
what? this is the best???? in New York City???????
The MRT terminal in Singapore is still cleaner and much better (albeit not as complex as that of New York's Subway)
"If you were filming this in Baltimore, you'd have a much harder time.




They're all bad."
"Hudson yards is basically like a tube station that we have here in London, every tube station has corridors and escalators like that"
Check out Moscows best subway stations and you will laugh at NYC
"I'd say Lexington—63rd, WTC—Cortlandt, and South Ferry—Whitehall should be up there."
Boring 😵
Hexagon is six sides octagon eight sides. Lol either way great video man just subbed!!
this made me miss my city :(
"Oculus station looks so impressive. Wish NYC built more fancy stations like this, or at least re-modern the train or build stations like the one under Hudson Yards"
no screen doors on the plateform?
Bryant park golden roots art
34th Street Broadway and Sixth Line is a nice station.
"Westfield World Trade Center is a shopping mall at the World Trade Center complex in Manhattan, New York, that is operated and managed by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. The mall opened on August 16, 2016 as the largest shopping complex in Manhattan, with 125 retail spaces. It replaces the Mall at the World Trade Center, the underground shopping mall under the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001. Its not MTA subway station"
"The 2nd ave subway wasn't kept as clean as it should have been since it's still new. It's a shame it took a pandemic to get the MTA to have it being cleaned the way it was now.
I was leaving for work and there were 5 workers scrubbing the floors early in the morning!"
"Those are hexagons, not octagons. ;)"
The best stations in nyc are like the shit ones in London
there are quite the few most of them are dumps
ALL train stations better look like this soon if im paying 2.75 each trip
wow the first one looks like metro stations in dc
from unpleasant to fascinating subway stations. u could make a stint as a host on 'NatGeo Travel' bro!
he didnt step a foot outside Manhattan.
"favorite subway systems:  DC, Paris, Moscow, St Petersburg"
It’s so sad that the MTA makes so much money but only spends money on the stations near the privileged in NYC.
Just waiting for Master Splinter to enter the new stations some day.
Personally my favorite station is Lexington Ave 63rd st
the third station looks like penn kinda haha
Which 23rd st station has hats?
You might go to the Whitehall where it is next to the Staten Island Ferry. The 1 train line is very cool. Before the hurricane was there it was ugly. Now if you got to the 1 line it's beautiful. You forgot that part.
I love NYC. I mis the old NYC from years ago. Like if you agree that NYC was better last year than with covid-19
PATH. World Trade Center. Number 1.
skunt baii
"Hii, enjoy watching your stuff :)
Since you’re asking, i would REALLY love to know about all the cool subway rides that have OUTSIDE VIEWS🙏🏽"
I hope you could visit the subway systems in asia and europe.
What’s up with that thumbnail face
"You missed 3 GREAT stations....
1. Coney Island - D/F/N/Q lines - as that one looks a lot like a European Rail Station. Very modern yet traditional..


2. East Tremont Avenue on the 2/5 lines. This renovated station has beautiful stained glass caricatures of some of the animals in the nearby Bronx Zoo


3. Pelham Parkway 2/5 lines - same as East Tremont.."
"Hudson Street station is very similar design to the stations we have here in Sydney for the Metro Train network (Driverless, underground railway system)."
The oculus is one of my favorite buildings now
You never taken the 1 train which have 2 cool stations stops
Visit Moscow to see the best subway system in the World
WTC Cortlandt Station is nice....you should do an updated best subways....so much has change in one year
"10:17 ""Octagonal"""
8:53 looks like Canary Wharf
"For me as a European, many of those stations look pretty ugly..."
Anyone ask for the beavers at Astor Place station?
"This is your best station""?"
Most stations on  the Q train is decent. My favorite Stations along the Q train is Sheepshead Bay . The platform is clean . Stilwell Ave in Coney Island is decent .You can connect with the D F Q and after repairs the N train. Ave X on the F train is decent station. And  Yes American Museum of Natural History is Beautiful Station. Great video .I liked it.
34 Street Hudson Yard reminds me of Canary Wharf in my native London 😄
What about Grand Central Terminal?
I’m surprised Coney Island wasn’t on the list. Such a great view of all the rides.
To much of your face and not enough subway.
34 street reminds me of the main underground train station in my area.
I live on East 82nd St and I take the Q all the time Edit: I’ve eaten at the Fulton St station and Shake Shack and City Hall I got off at the stop after it and walked to it and filmed a 4 and 6 go through it
"i like this dude thank you for uploading it is appreciated . i think these subways look space age, futuristic and dynamic ☮♥ to everyone forever."
Stilwell's much better ever since the renovation.
Coney Island station at the Aquarium is very cool with aquatic 3D sculptures built into the platform and walkway walls.
"Imagine Paying For Your Fare lol
FUCK THAT 2.75"
The Hudson Yards escalator is a total trip! That was my first ride on the subway and I was wondering if they were all like that. Nope! Gonna ride Canal Street tomorrow. 😖
Dump City
"For all the people saying the system is dirty, I think you forgot it was built in 1904."
WTC Transit Hub ( the Oculus) becomes I was part of the testing and construction team
south ferry is brand new too
Love all your videos!
72nd street is my school’s stop! woop
"Grand Central, Atlantic Avenue, Jamaica (LIRR concourse), herald square, penn station soon hopefully, south ferry renovation to name a few worth looking into"
There’s a tour through old city hall you can pay for.
The Fulton center
"Great! I loved your video.Well, I´ve been there and they are cool."
"42nd Street Station is also the location of the Martin Scorsese directed, Michael Jackson video ""Bad"" featuring Wesley Snipes."
This might not count as a subway but the Path Train station at the World Trade Center is really beautiful.   It’s in oculus.   It’s all bright white/ glass  and has  futuristic looking lighting.  I’d definitely recommend checking it out.
2:31 This is... 86 St ❤️ OMG I miss those sounds 😔🇺🇸🗽🚇
is it just me or our country train station are better?
Check out the WTC station
Ok the worst and the best. That's what I'm talking about. Nice work!
"Not fond of Manhattan stations except for Fulton. Too much underground, long escalators with the new ones, takes forever to get to the train.

My 2 favorite, B & Q's Kings Hwy: 4 track outdoor beautiful, bustling environment. Those are the best. And the new 39th Ave on the N, W. Artsy, entirely made of glass. Rare transparent station, a must see. Neither have strict directional entry."
Even the best stations in NYC are ugly
"Those octagons at ""The Hive"" look more like hexagons."
Oh my itsy bitsy ritzy trains around the upper East side
I haven’t been in (only through) the 1 -World Trade Center stop but it looks great from the train
You didn’t see Atlantic Av Barclays ctr
34st. Hudson Yards.
You should do a video on Japan's train stations.
Man I wanna invite you to New Delhi to try out the Delhi metro
0:14 o shit those are the motown guys

"Of course he shows the most modern/renovated stations. But what about the other boroughs? He only stays in Manhattan like wtf? The outer boroughs have some great stations too! What about Marcy ave? You can get great shots of the area or what about Coney Island for god sake???.Or Smiths 9th st station, which you can get great shots there of lower Manhattan. It's the highest station in the system. Or what about the Qns blvd viaduct of the 7 line? Or the newly renovated stations in Astoria? Like c'mon dude. Manhattan ain't the only borough shit!"
"MISERICÓRDIA, O QUE O LULA TA FAZENDO AQUI? 3:09 KKKKKKKKK"
Which 23rd st? It's either for 8th Ave or Broadway
This is off-topic but in the other end of the 7 train where it's flushing queens I live there lol
The Oculus station is my favorite.
"i was waiting for fulton like i- 

also u forgot 59th columbus circle, grand central, atlantic terminal"
The new South Ferry Station on the 1 line and the renovated Coney Island Station.
"None of the ppl doing performances are sober. Not one.
Used to hang with the types when I was in a bad way. Definitely more respectable than panhandling if you're at least entertaining."
"Yup, also 161st Street - Yankee Stadium (Bronx), Howard Beach - JFK (Queens), Coney Island - Stillwell Avenue (Brooklyn), etc..."
 @michaelmorales1475  totally agree. The list of this video sucks
"Brooklyn Coney Island train station, Smith and 9 st F/G train station, and any train that go over the east river bridges so you can see the Brooklyn and Manhattan sights"
"No wonder you saved Oculus for near the end. Definitely, gucci. Definitely hi speed, lo drag"
"You know the newer architecture is remarkably similar to that of the WMATA stations ( in DC ). It's a very nice change, I think. Thanks for the tour."
My favorite one is “125th street” (1 train)
"I really cringed when he kept leaving the stations, man either has to pay again or hop it or do the real g shit and YANK the fuck outta that emergency door"
"Love your video's and this one as well. My wife and I are going to NYC 12/5-12/9 I was born and raised there , she has never been there. I moved from NYC at the end of 1975. I am like a new tourist there now as many of these lines are new or I forgot them. I may have to do Lyft or Uber as stairs and my knees don't make friends.  ILooking at all you have shown I feel as if I went to sleep in 1975 and awoke in 2019, I hope I can get around. Keep up the good work."
"i feel so special, this was uploaded on my birthday <3"
"Jamaica Station way out at the end of the E line was quite nice when it first opened back in the 1980s... it was the first new underground station the MTA had built in decades (save for Roosevelt Island).  But it's not so nice anymore.  Like everything else in the outer boroughs, it's been allowed to go to hell very quickly."
125th
NOPE! New York too busy too crowded big nope!
"Unlike old metro , subway, tram systems of superpowers , New York city, Ukraine cities, Russian cities, Georgian cities, Romanian cities built in the year 1930s, 1940s and never replaced with new wagons and trams ; Turkey's laggardness has led to metro , subway, tram systems to be extremely new, from the beginning of year 2010s and onwards in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Antalya, Samsun, Eskisehir cities, all of them have brand new wagons. My instagram is   hakanozcanankara   Turkey has only 3000 kms of motorways in total from Edirne to Ankara city, from Mersin city to Sanliurfa city and from Istanbul city to Aydin city motorways only. In 200 years time Turkey can reach USA standards and widespreadness of  motorways and highways in the country of just 780.000 square kms area compared to USA area of 14 million square kms. Turkey has 81 cities and Istanbul Airport which is the biggest and largest in the world, is  just 10 hours flight from NY city."
Most overrated subway on earth!
Thank you for this video
The World Trade Center station was my favorite during my trip.
Hexagonal!!!!
You and John are my all time favorites! Keep up the great work my friend! I was born in Jersey City at the old Margaret Hague!
Nice your from
Coney Island Stillwell Avenue!!
"You missed allot on this Video. At least do a little history as to when the station were originally built and opened. 
Grand Central 42nd st. Terminal (underground people)
Atlantic / Pacific st. Station (Barclays center)
Jay St. Borough Hall ( City Tech / Metrol )
Columbus Circle 
Bowling Green station 
14th St. Station (A/C line)

Many of the capital expenditures are applied to infrastructure in Manhattan ( typically that's the New York that the average tourist sees ). It comes as no surprise that stations in outlying areas may be low in the pecking order
"If that's the justification,  @smoothjazzaxe  , as indeed it may well be, then I think it's about time residents in those deliberately underserved areas began hitting back.  Let them begin by withholding their NYC income and property taxes."
 @litlgrey  yeah since i'm no longer a NY resident that's definitely not for me to say
"Understood,  @smoothjazzaxe  .  Neither am I.  Not anymore."
Samuel Mottweiler same
But overall good video right?
1 Train WTC Cortland station
"As someone who resides in Queens, I did not like the 7 train extension. More people on the train, the 7 can't even handle Queens alone. Lol."
"Hey, shithead. Stop filming yourself. Show viewers the damn station. FFS."
"I spent some years in my youth in NYC 88-92 time frame. I have been in Tokyo  Met. since 93. The Tokyo 6 Shibuya, Shinjuku,Tokyo, Uneo, Shin and IkB plus Yokohama and Kawasaki make 42nd St and Grand Cent.  look like small countryside stations with no riders and 1 old attendant sweeping up about to go home."
What about wtc station

IF you''re reading these....what size in FL. OZ. ARE YOUR LG. COFFEE MUGS?  It's not listed....I hate  buying a 'small'/large Mug!
My favorite stations are Grand Central 42 Street and Fulton Street
Morgan st station is really nice because of the tiles. Also there a station off fifth avenue which has a subway and a Dunkin doughnuts but the aesthetic and vibe in it is really nice. Can’t remember what side street it’s on through.
in the city
i go to school with my bffs
my fav is oculus- world trade center
What’s your recommendation for navigating the subways if it’s your first time using them?
Cool video blog post on YouTube and have more new video blog post on YouTube and you should come to the lefferts Blvd a train station do you a a station tour of the lefferts Blvd a train station
"The Second Avenue subway stations look nice today, but come back in a few years...."
What about grand central and penn
What about Cortlandt Street on the 1 Line.
I'm suprised because this is in new york city
i liked Bleecker str station with the LED the most. Stations are clean and nice
"I'm a train nut that was raised 22 miles to the east of Manhattan, in Roslyn. I've never been able to understand, much less explain, my love for trains, but it is intense. I used to cut school, starting in the 7th Grade, and I'd take the LIRR into Penn Station and then ride the subways all day. I've said this a million times, but it is true: ""There isn't a train I wouldn't ride, no matter where it's going.""


You, sir, have brought joy to my life. Thank you."
I love you intro my dude
Wtf why does the Fulton center stations look like an airport
Jai Shri Krishna it's good to see people from Hari Krishna group in foreign land
I'd say two of my most favorite subway stations in NYC would definitely have to be both Fulton Center and the Oculus at WTC! Glad you put those two for the last ones in this video. Also the Hudson Yards station is kinda cool looking too; but I still like both the WTC and Fulton ones better; because they have a lot more to offer as well as a shopping mall!
3:10 é o Lula? Kkkkkkk
OMG... this was cool to see... my hubby and i have never been to NYC and so this was really educational 8)
"I live in the Bronx, and want to put in my vote for the best Bronx station: the 2/5 station at Gun Hill Road (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Hill_Road_(IRT_White_Plains_Road_Line)). It's a renovated station - by far not the newest (work was reportedly done beetween 2004 and 2006) but impressive when you come upon it. The station is unique in the following way, at least among Bronx stations: You pay your fare on entry at ground level. There are then escalators and elevators; beware the escalators because they don't go all the way to track level; you are confronted with a flight of stairs...but the elevators go all the way up to the track level. 
The station decades ago was bi-level, serving the long-defunct 8 train, itself the last extension of the Third Avenue Elevated and that closed in 1973. In those days, of course, there was no thought of elevators or escalators at this station! 
The only down side of this station is if one or another elevator is down; you're going to do some stair walking. Check the MTA website to avoid surprises."
Great video of NYC subway stations. Subscribed!
I’m surprised you didn’t check out Columbus Circle with the underground market it’s a dope spot
You forgot the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens.
The Columbus Circle station is so nice.
"i actually went there with my friends for my birthday ,, it was honestly super cool ."
exactly this is a great station to check out
"can confirm used it every day for a week when i was visiting and the underground market was very very neat for breakfast and lunch, cuz we were trying to do as much as possible"
"Legit, I’d just go to Columbus Circle just to go to Chickncone."
"Or Fulton Street, with the mini mall and glass elevators"
i go to columbus circle all the time because my college is near there
"Herald Square train station, 34th and 6th Ave N/R lines (Urban instruments called Reach) check it out."
The World Trade Center station is so nice and clean
In  Brazil  Sao Paulo  this is  the way  our the worst  tube station  looks like .
The hats at the 23rd st station pay homage to the Garment District
"There are five 23rd St stations in Nyc. Which line did you film for 23rd St station with the hats. #6, R&W, F&M, #1, C&E?"
When I clicked on this I knew the Q stations on the upper east side had to be in it
That outside Design is something they stole from D.C. We have that everywhere
How many times did he say the word “station”?😂
Didn't know you are Jewish. Shalom 🤙🏽
About the Hats in the 23rd St station: https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/story-behind-mosaic-hats-23rd-st-subway-stop-article-1.2634411
my favorit subway station in NYC is 34rd Street Hudson Yards because it takes me to Citi Field
"You missed South Ferry station, its one of my favorites"
Of course it's nice in the rich part of the city..ride the q to train to the projects in Coney island Brooklyn different story 😂😂😂😂👉👉
"Great train stations, on the Q Train Stations! Great work!"
Is that the best you've got in NYC my country metro station are far more better than yours
"Compared to some metro stations in Paris, the Natural History Museum Station is pretty unimpressive"
"World Trade Center isn’t a subway station, it’s a high tech shopping mall that you can take the train to."

My science teacher wore jeans and his pajama shirt for a dress up day but the theme was ‘surfer’ and when asked why he was wearing jeans he said ‘I wear jeans to the beach’ and played this song. Less than five minutes later he and a freshman girl got into a cotton-eyed-joe dance battle.
"Wait. Tank Bank, Radio Shack manager turned fur trader, sang this? Incredible"
"it is criminal that this song isn't longer cuz it plays in my mind endlessly. fuck you, but thanks."
I feel personally attacked.
"I read the title as ""Jesus at the beach"" and thought yeah makes sense it probably isn't very fun for him."

The song is simple. Catchy and yet, has meaning."
But what about the sand? It gets everywhere and on everything.

"Thanks man, the shirts a German Heirloom"

😳
Now THIS is my shit.
this gives me bdg vibes
"Hi Just Somebody's Dad, I'm Jean"
"I, for one, VALUE and ADMIRE your style"
I don't know why but I love this!
"Listen, I'm not under-prepared for the beach, you don't understand how badly my legs need the microdermabrasive effects of sand trapped in denim and frankly, it's free sand. Think of the savings."
I just got out of Gus Johnson's comedy show from his tour and both somebody else there as well as Gus himself recognized the Value Select shirt I was wearing. Thought that was pretty cool.
So that's where my dad went
That family photo is pretty nice man just you and your jeans on the beach that's all you need really
"eee eeee eee 
means I love you in Dolphin"
Much respect to you man! Keep up the creativity and humor and good things will come your way! - that's a fortune cookie promise
......thank you YouTube?  I guess
dad has an existencial crisis on beach
Value Select is good I think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oJ9KYkn0ys
I have a dad
send your feet pics to me now and your jeans won't get hurt
Missed you
If possible please get on Spotify I'd love to toss your music in a few of my shared playlists with friends
A fellow beach man.
WE ASCEND TOGETHER.
Gus and Value Select should collab that would be magical
"Hold up, there's Value Select Merch? How do I get my Hands on that?"
" @Stardyver  It was limited run about a month ago. If I had to guess, there's probably more coming soon since the channel has about tripled in size since then."
" @braxtonschultz2159  Damnit, I missed that! Cheers for the Answer, I'll keep my eye out for new stuff."
Who is that?
That makes me so goddamn happy omg. I love both these channels and they're so consistently quality without overstaying their welcome just to fit an algorithm! To hear they're fans of one another is like super heartwarming
Hakuna Matata lol that's not Gus 😂
just watch so they don't get posessed.
this comment aged like milk
 @hanfran9698  😭
 @braxtonschultz2159  I know I know 😭😭
hey is that really shrek wow
why am i like this
Literally every upload is a hidden jem of YouTube that needs to be studied and appreciated
Like this to show you were here before tiktok takes over the song
Barry during the beach cycle
See guys this a funny joke because people don’t wear jeans on the beach because it’s usually hot and sand gets in them so it doesn’t work good
"this has joined my top 2 favorite songs of all time list with the smash hit ""hit me with your car""
I sincerely hope they finally release the full game, the demos of them just aren't enough to satiate me"
Look at the like to dislike ratio;) nice
"Soooooooooooooooo

When are we going to get a Tank Banks musical?"
"Save this lost man, save his soul."
Why does this sounds like super smash bros melee beginning lowkey? I need answers @valueselect
Jeans at the beach gives me the heeby jeebies.
Honestly the arm whip sound effects in the beginning made me lose it.
You should collab with Bill Wurtz.
Masterpiece!
"I would love to see you colab with Caroline Konstnar. There is a similar vibe or something between you two, I can't quite put my finger on it."
This is one of the best of the things on the internet. Like ever.
...and don't forget beach gloves. I like my fingers toasty.
Now that's a value selection.
That is a minor sin
"Come to the beach with me, Algorithm!"
major bdg vibes.
Bruh the Highest of IQ jokes is the beach jean combo
Value Select well my IQ is very high that’s why I can explain these memes
"Once I get Infinity Ward to pay for production, you better believe VS REMASTERED is coming to town."
We Ascend into the Ideal Ratio!
Tank Bank Musical by 2024
Value Select I will hold you to that Mr. Select 👍🏼
What are jeans...? Who is beach...? And why together?
My subconscious is telling me its time to brawl
Understandable
Beachy Jeenies
Gotta love the cartoon style sfx
"If I knew how, I would."
Much love to you my brother!
"Get a band of brothers together, and storm her comment section! Demand a collaboration!"
"You honor me August, much love to you my brother!"
"Sandy, Toasty, Beachy Jeans."
May We Tread Upon Serpents and Expose Scorpions with this Beach Jeans Song!
ALL HAIL THE ALGORITHM! SACRIFICE CONSUMED!
"He is my son, and I love him"
No wonder I love Value Select. Youre right.
"I woke up and in my half-asleep state, I thought the title said 'Jesus at the beach'. I have to say though this song was wayyyy better than whatever I was expecting"
I remember when I took a family photo of 1 with my dad
"ahh i miss the ""perfect"" line"
"Well... I guess that was a video.

P.S. Cool initiative by him to shoutout other peeps and I gotta say you video quite well"
How cruel we are to judge a man and his dreams.
"I’m so glad musical comedy skits have still survived somewhere on YouTube, you’re a legend."
I love his channel! Found one of his videos on random when I was searching for something else. I love his skits and songs! They always get a chuckle out of me. He really deserves way more subscribers
You forgot the AirPods!
"Don't worry, you got a jean brother in me."
This hit me hard man.
GODDAMNIT THESE SONGS ARE SO GOOD. maybe make a full 2 minute song sometime?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pffft How else are you planning to prevent saddle sores? Jeans are the PRACTICAL mans' choice
Very cool!
Jeanie of the beach
I feel personally attacked
"I don't like sand.

I have no jeans and I must scream.
"Much love to you brother, we're gonna make it!"
"Value Select I believe in you! No matter what numbers you get just know I’m always watching these and fully appreciating them, you do great work brother!"

"sand is literally hitler, ban sand"
Wow that like dislike ratio is insane
I have absolutely no idea what I watched but I appreciate this late night upload.
"eee eeee eee all, hope y'all know that"
I expect an update in a decade with eight children and one very lean and jean'd fighting machine Dad.
...Dad?
i feel attacked
I adore these really short hilarious vids. Thank you for always bringing a smile to my face. Really needed this at 2 in the morn.
"I wore jeans at the beach once.

I don’t exist anymore"
"Where’s the “PERFECT” Max? My children are tugging at my loose ankle skin asking for food. What am I supposed to tell them now, huh?"
"The best content I have seen in a while.
Worth subscribing and use the notification bell for!"
Headed to Hawaii tomorrow. Will take this outfit
"Make sure to take home a pocket full of sand as a souvenir! Most important part of wearing jeans at the beach is all the pockets you get to fill with sand and ruin forever. (Real question though, do you wear jeans with socks and sandals? Is that TOO tacky?? I leave that up to you.)"
"i did many things to get to this video as quickly as I could

im glad I did"
eee eeee eee too Mr Select
Perfect!
"Always nice to see a dad out having fun.

Now if you just stop drinking you can get back custody of your kids"
This is the perfect song to hear as I sneak back into my house at 2 in the morning
We've Got The Best Brothers Out Here!
Hell yeah!
Love to you brother!
" @ValueSelectTV  I genuinely enjoy your content, bro. It's always cool to see some weird and original stuff."
eee eeee eee to you too my brother
"Love to you Luis, always enjoy reading your comments"
The video had to be 30 seconds or less for that sweet sweet /r/youtubehaiku reddit karma
There's a reason PERFECT is in caps at the end
WELCOME HOME BROTHER!
WELCOME HOME BROTHER

"69th like, nice."
Welcome Home
Better than socks with flip flops...
love it
"Treat me like a river.
Follow my thoughts upstream to the mountain where they were born. 
The colossal event that birthed my path or the absence of it."
"Finally, something I can relate too"
"should've just worn jorts, the pinnacle of jean function and fashion."
I'm convinced you run this channel just so you can wear those fake mustaches.
I'm not gunna lie to you Mr. Select. There was also a dolphin in that photo
If you don’t wear jeans where else do you keep the belt you use to beat your kids?
Notification gang❤️
Tank bank
"Thanks Max, try jorts! And by the way, I'd like to be in that family photo! A family can have two dads, a family can be two dads!"
The ending for this video is different for the one on instagram
Am I the first comment?
Hot
Blessings
We are ALL jeans today!
Wisdom for the Ages
make sure to not get blood on the jorts
 @oreo625  BDG reference? Nice
 @blue-lf1po  hey bucko its jort season
Not true jorts get rid of all the function that jeans provide
" @biscuitboy4782  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx3ORAO1Y6s

Nah."
" @oreo625  no, thats only in the process of making the jorts."
"if you need to know how to make some, Brian David Gilbert has ya covered"

"I don’t really understand why Joe Rogan hates vegans so much. He talks about it so much, why doesn’t he just debate them properly instead of just making these comments."
Good work
"How do you know someone is a vegan?


Joe Rogan will tell you"
Tremendous
Joe got dumped by a vegan and hasn't let it go.
"Please for your next video: please make a video of all the Biden and Trump talking gaffes, preferably fake debating each other."
It takes me all day to make one podcast mashup video that's about 3 minutes long. This must have took ages.
All four thumbs down on this video are rabid vegans for sure
6:51
This is a great cut man 😂
Looks like Joe Rogan isn't very fond of the vegans
the vegans are dominating lmfao
"Yea, well, ahahahahahaha!"
but why
Vegavegavegavegavgeavegan.
"We have to get him to talk about this, in his podcast so it would be then clipped by JRE clips, and ola Vegan Inception via Joe Rogan."
"I admire Joe for how impartial he is actively trying to be on so many different issues. Not saying he always is but you can see the effort on his part to stay somewhat objective.

Veganism however, or meat consumption rather, is a topic where Joe is unbearably biased to the point where he doesn't shy away from spreading misinformation.

The moment Joe says the word vegan is the moment I ffwd 10 minutes, or outright skip the episode.

And no, I'm not vegan myself."
German Joe Rogan
Who has this much time?!  Give me your energy.
I like this.
so long lol
What misinformation is he spreading?
It's almost like his entire personality is wrapped up in a diet.
90% of all vegans are vegan
Why would you do this? Why would ANYONE do this?!  I'm trying to imagine the amount of time that went into making this and...is everything okay at home?
DMT is vegan
"I like the bad faith of this video ""every time he says vegan except when I want you to hear select sentences of him talking shit"""
I actually watched this for seven whole minutes before wondering what I’m doing with my life.
LITERALLY WILL SINGLE HANDEDLY CAUSE HIM TO CHANGE HIS SPEECH.
Rabbit vegan.

I can't believe how unprofessional The Onion is! To not even have children working amongst them. Truly a retrograde news channel!
"The ""help me"" on the pants was hysterical."
"With the laws recently passed in Iowa and Arkansas legalizing child labor,  we will be able to rest easy knowing that the US is no longer outsourcing garment making to other countries.
When you wear GAP you will be able to proudly say you are giving American children work opportunities 😊"

We need that sense of hard work back in America culture! Can we encourage or sponsor those kids to come here and work in our new factories we could build just for them? We could put Americans kids alongside them for them to learn English and Americans to relearn work ethic.

Jeff:erase your online fashion outfits photos (without any much skin showing) buy tretinoin (so SouthKorean doctors and stazi losers might again illegally bully&stalk you after your online tretinoin purchase with a SouthKorean bank visa or mastercard card) while the whole SouthKorean nation stopped importing 0.1%tretinoin even from global phamaceutical companies

There’s a gap between the wearer and others… people made kids read such scripts.

I guess what the similarity really exposes is that The Onion's sense of humor is unchanging, yet timeless, so much that the same joke is funny when they do it twice."
Brian Scott reminds me a lot of Brian Todd. Kind of looks and sounds and acts like him. You may remember Brian Todd from various shapeshifting reptilian videos that keep getting scrubbed from the internet.

Sounds more like labour to me

I thought this was gonna be like the kids are designing the clothes and they happen to be absolute abominations.

Working at the gap is horrible unless you are part of the culture.
This would actually be a really good national weight-loss initiative too. Imagine millions of fat little kids toiling away all day without eating anything and sweating in over 100-degree factories. I'm sure we would be able to cut our obesity rate in half!

" @mrdavinenglishlessons4674  they aren’t trying to spread lies, their goal is to provide entertainment in a fun way. The titles of their satire and not purposely harming videos used to be so very unbelievable, but now those same titles are things that might actually happen irl and people believe them"
 @f1redemon966  i can't believe you are defending liars and fake news. I suppose you think Breitbart and Fox is 'entertaining and in a fun way' too. What is wrong with the world today?
" @mrdavinenglishlessons4674  i cant believe you dont know the definition of satire. ""the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.""

Yes mate I also saw the video.
Wait you don't have a sweatshop of kids that make all of the clothes that you need? You're just not forward-thinking
what?? you dont know what youre talking about
I think i am perfectly speaking. I let the managers handle the kids and i get quality clothes
Getting a say in where you work is a form of free speech. And all ages should have their freedom of speech protected.
Yeah but if they don't make clothes food isn't a right
 @jacobryan4569  when people reply to this comment theyre not replying to you lol
I don't know I am just crazy
Well they technically are...
They import some of their clothes from my country i think snd they don’t pay them enough so they are forced to work their chikdren
This is got to be a joke they work for 12 hours without eating or anything some kids are only six years old this is a bad joke especially the pants that say help me it’s a bad joke
I was going to make a joke about child labor judging by the name but this a joke in its self.
"“New”? This post was made 13 years ago, I was like 2 when this game out lol"

Plot twist: this is actually happening right now as you read this comment in Xinjiang China.
Oh noooooooooo this is about child labor 😭😭 when I saw the title I thought of an actual line that came out sometime recently about a child owned mlm fashion company or something...
"""They love working from sunup to sundown, without even stopping to eat.""
Aw, how industrious. Those children must love their jobs!"
I never knew that Malaysia have buildings that looked like that. Interesting.

Sometimes I like to think that this is what other countries took inspiration from when they thought of child labor.
Child labour intensifies this is terrible. One like equal 1 less child labourer

It’s called a ride or die
Cant tell if im That Friend or if im The Concerned one... maybe a lil bit of Both? Cant really Imagine my friends be that down. Unless it's a Different kind of Down
This is hilarious! “Did you follow me to my house?😳” The facial expressions slay me.
"I thought you were serious.

I'M DEAD serious

....Hello?"
BRO WHERE DID YOU GET THAT JACKET
"Down syndrome kind of down? sounds like me
Love this guy, caleb is funny.."
" @cipher698  Yeah you're Down, but not THIS type of down..





You're down to Fuck"
Soooo basically confident stalkers?
"I love how at the end, he didn't even know who it was. He just started hitting people."
When you've maxed out your bond level with that ally in fire emblem 🤣
The homie entered his villain arc
Why have I never seen this one before
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I miss friends like this 🤣🤣
I love how he said “I’m tired of him” like he knew him lol
"“Did you follow me to my house?”
Nah he got waypoints"
"I'm late to the party with finding out about this channel, but definitely not regretting this somehow showing up on my feed. Sh!t's hilarious 😆😆😆"
One of my favs
I wonder why he's pronouncing Jameron like that.
I’m gonna start hitting people(for no reason..)..!😂🤣😂

When you're the main protagonist's motivation

Gokudera to Tsuna:
Whatchu doin bro? Lmaooooooooo
"Strangely enough... a dude in my gym class started a one-on-one fight against me because I was uncontrollably laughing about I just won at a hockey game versus his powerhouse dream team... which my team, including myself, looked like we did not have a chance at scoring, but reigned 7 to their 4. At first... it seemed weird that my teacher chose who will be on my side... then later he told me he quickly realized I'm many times too skillful for the vast majority. Anyhow, that dude... much stronger than myself... sucker-punched my right-eye, which I dropped him with a solid elbow. He soon after apologized to me... even told me I was the only kid out of over 100 able to win a fight against him. I fully forgave him, however... what I didn't know was that a whole lot of people would gang up on him everywhere he went because dude picked a fight against me."
yo he moved
Jesus and the crusades be like
anyone knows the name of the ringtone he has.
"Friend: ""I really hate waking up early""

Loyalist Friend: [Confirmed: eradicate all time in this sector]"
Everyone needs a friend like this
"""YOU KNOW WHAT, I'MMA TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER. I WILL KILL THEM!""

bass drop"
I'm just gonna start hitting people....
I’m that friend 😭😭😭😭
Radom guy getting his ass beat: but I don't even have a car
I got friends like this. I legit had a convo similar to this a few days ago...
gus fring
Dragons dogma companions be like😂
NORMALAIZE FRIENDS LIKE THIS
1:17
That's how I feel about my homie.
Yandere detected
"As soon as he said “im dead serious”
We all knew what was about to go down"
"1:15 Friendship so strong, he was able to teleport."
Lol 😂
Sooooo... That's not what how we handle neighbors parking in our friend's spot?🤔🤔🤷🏿🤷🏿
The ear switch with te phone showed me how serious this was
Thas crazy jit punching people for no reason
Yandere be like
Bro did not walk outside to calm him down at all
Whatchu doin bro aahhgghgghgg
"“Let’s get this done, I’m tired of him!”
But he never met the guy"
"I was not ready for him to say he'd just kill him, genuinely took me by surprise 😂"
Imagine that your friend did the crime for helping u
I’m too down
0:50
"""I'll take it one step further-ill kill em!"".
Caleb,"" hello.bro your connection is getting pretty bad"".lol"
AHHAAAHAHAHA LMFAO
…..hello
Yk...I wouldn't even mind friends likes these🤣💯
Wow that got dark!
I don't have that kind of friend because I have no friends 😎
"1:03 we need a montage of all of these moments from all of his video, that alone is funny as shit"
yandere friend
"im not sure why but im sure i heard this once, from someone i knew. worded differently but same format.."
this is the least relatable thing i've seen in a while
I just realised something… I might be this friend. Whoops.
This basically Eren to his friends
0:56 sounded like something from regular show for a moment
You for real sound like goku
“I’m tired of him” he just knew him awhile ago. That’s crazzzyy 😂
He on the phone with Longbeachgriffy 😂😂
"Cameron, I'm pretty sure the key word was Tow, not Assualt. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
Omg that’s my friend Tyler he is so down for me 😂
It's great to find a video by him that I haven't watched yet
Deadass. Me and everyone of my friends are like this
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes You wish for a nuclear winte
"NO MORE PARKING

lmao"
Is that the anime character that turns anything into a motivational speech? 😂
"I deadass have a friend just like this bro, my ego blows the up around him LMAO"
Aaannnnd…. Here I am again lol
"Caleb was a master class in un-implicating himself from the potential crime that Cameron was about to commit.
- He caught on early once his friend's tone got aggressive.
- Tried to diffuse the situation by minimizing the seriousness of his neighbor's offense.
- Expressed that he thought the conversation was all supposed to be joking.
- Acted like the line was breaking up so he can deny hearing anything that Cameron says.
- Ignored his friend's requests for disclosing which house was the offending neighbor's.
- Repeatedly asked Cameron if he followed him home. This solidifies that Cameron was acting entirely alone and Caleb didn't indirectly abet Cameron's crime."
I feel that this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msBNXwNlN4g&t=250s is a sequal to this video.
"""I'M DEAD SERIOUS.""



-Hello?
That killed me holy crap."
"1:03 Kills me everytime. ""Hello?!"""
Now if only I could have a friend like that
😂😂😂😂 this so true 😂😂😂
1:09 we all make that face in this situation
This shit is hilarious! I needed that laugh 😂

That went 0 to 100 really quick 😂
🧠⏰📝💢
Peacemaker and Vigilante.
Straight Aries energy
He just starts throwing hands with the first person he sees
"man, i wish i had friends :c"
its giving suzanne from OINTB
This is Eren in AoT killing everybody for his homies happiness
I remember the day This video came out 2 years ago wtf
"Having the foresight of how this part of the anime goes, we should’ve seen it coming that Caleb was so down bad for Caleb that he was willing to murder to get his approval.  Damn, Caleb’s at it again with working these arcs."
Dripped...... btw cool jacket
Bruh😂
Yo- did I get unsubscribed?
That’s a powerful assed coat.  I’m after one now.
From the title I was expecting a super depressed friend or something. This was much better
This sounds like Teddy from Bob's burgers haha
Praise the lord 💗 thank you Jesus Christ for being our savior
“I’M ABOUT TO JUST START HITTING PEOPLE”😭😭😭
This has to be in my top favs of Caleb videos lol he’s so goofy 😂
Eren Yager when he got the founding titan power
👀 im cam
This hit real close to home. 😂🤣
Can someone link me to where he got his jacket
This one had 💀
that gave me longbeachgriffy vibes
"The Pre-Shill Era, Good Times"
"I need a friend like that, my neighbours have a parking spot AND a garage and they'd park in my spot all the time 😩"
"Bruh I tried finding that jacket but I’m not able to, someone help"
1:12 whats that song?
The fact his mans came over there for the ruckus in slides.....
is he talking to longbeachgriffy?
So true loll
This is a Griffy plot
Its good to say i have quite alot of these friends
I used to treat someone like this 💀
A true bro
this would be me if i had more confidence
"How you mean?

His newer vids ain't good?"
 @HughJass-jv2lt  He hates Caleb being compensated for his work by getting sponsors
" @nero252  
🤣🤣

Haters gonna Hate.... I suppose."
Check Description
"I have a friend like this. She’s called my
Mum"
I need a friend like that
POV: you’re friends with Valkyrae
How did this come out two years ago? Where did the time go.
I'm this kind of big brother and father.
lmao is that griffy
Oh this nigga an Aries cause...
Is this because of cultural appropriation that I can't understand any word of the particular dialogue
this is me af
Well I guess I am that kind of friend. BUT NO ONE CAN F**K WITH MY FRIENDS 😬😬
"i will kill him

caleb: your connection is pretty bad bro..."
Me with my friends:
Those type of friends always got hands for days
“Broooo whyyyyy” 😂
I wish I have friend like this
Honestly though my friends would take the bit that far. Only difference is actually beating strangers up.
I wan't that yellow jacket
This is the first suspense comedy maybe ever.
"This reminds me of that one time where I casually mentioned to my 2 friends that this kid spread a rumor that he beat me up.  Well, they took it upon themselves to start beating the shit out of him right then and there."
When you’re bffs with Kanye🤣
"Ah, fuck, it's me."
I come back and laugh at this every so often
That yellow jacket is great 👏😁
MAN I'M OUT OF BREATH LMAFOOO
I do this hoping they'll do the same for me 💀
Sadly... i am that friend
Where u got that jacket
It's over for him no more parking!
This video was amusing and made me laugh. That is all
STOP PARKING AT HIS HOUSE 😡🤜🏿
"This is freaky because when i was like 11, my neighbor (like 30/40 sumn) shot and killed somebody for taking my other neighbors parking spot. Things became worst when he ran and the cops threatened to take his kids away from their mom. He was a good person who looked out for his own, but over a parking spot. I miss their family. My family probably would have stayed there for a few more years if that didn't happen. Because after the mom moved away with her kids, the next neighbor brought an infestation of roaches and the apartment owners werent doing anything about it."
"""I'm about to just start hitting people""
Immediately starts whoopin someone's"
“F**k this guy”💀💀💀💀
longbeach
thats no one else but the legened himself
I wish I had friends...
"Honestly though, parking in someone's driveway is a dickmove. His friend did the right thing .."
Sometimes I'm this friend
This aggressive positivity is what I need in my life...minus that stalking part...and battery....
"Plot twist, there is no friend. He's talking to himself."
I want that jacket wtf. give.
his jacket is sick
When you're such a good person people are will to commit acts of vandalism and terror in your name...wait...
The way he switched his phone hand
lol. one time in my senior year of high school a junior showed me some attitude and i just let him go with some talking. And i was just telling this story to my friend and all of a sudden he literally got up and when i mean literally he gathered like 50 boys from all the sec of my grade like nearly 50 minimum and told me to take him to the corner of the room for whoppinn him.I actually said i lied because i didnt want that kid to literally die. My friends were so disappointed in me but still i think i did that kid a great favour .But from that day no junior even raised a eye on me xd.

"""im bouta just start HITTIN PEOPLE"" LMAOOO"
"I’ll take this over mfs who pretend to be cool then leave you on read and always make plans and never keep ‘em lol

"I thought the yelling version of Caleb was Griffey, didn't it sound like him a lil bit?... I know I’m two years late lol 🤷🏼‍♀️"

Fire sign friend energy

"Great video, but that superdry coat looking hella dope"
Omg lmao I think mark jacked this video and made a version
He said I'm outside bright now 🤣
"I have a friend like that. She's a white Colombian, but always plays sister soldier, always finding a reason to protest, and encourages me to stand up for myself. But I be scared to tell her stuff, because I know I'm gonna hear ""Report it to (insert authority figure)"", or encouragement to tell someone off and cause chaos, and I just don't like stirring stuff up like that... I mean, I tell people off, but only when I'm at my boiling point."

"Timmy: My super power is that I can track almost anyone after I met them
Interviewer: that’s pretty amazing we could do some spying type shit with this.
Timmy: but it’s hard to activate douh I need to actively have good information on the person to track them almost anywhere.

"Hey. God loves you. You see, we are sinners in need of God’s grace, and we have broken God’s law, the Ten Commandments… But there is good news friend, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross so we could be saved from hell and live in heaven with Him after we die on earth! 
Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”’
Jesus loves you so much that He was willing to give His life on the cross for you! God wants a relationship with you! So put your faith in Jesus Christ today, and you will  be saved, and you will go to heaven when you die! Repent of your sins, ask God for forgiveness, and may the Lord richly bless you!
2 Corinthians 6:2 “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.❤️"
Markus and North from Detroit: Become Human be like
I’m bout to just start hittin ppl
"“Yo connection is pretty bad, bro. I can’t hear you AT ALL.”

Plausible deniability. Smart man."
"When he said ""wait did you say again"" I knew he was about to go crazy because I have a friend like that."
😂😂😂☠️🔫
Where is that beat from tho
This intro was such an awesome downtown hip hop lounge vibe. I really miss this show
"My Dad used to wake me and my brother up for school with this, he’d turn up the tv really loud so we can hear it from our rooms, aahh the memories!"
0:15
"Fun fact: Shawn, Marlon and Omar Epps produced the beat."
I love this beat. What's the name of this beat?
IM MEXICAN AND LOVE THIS SHIT
Simple times🇨🇻🇵🇹🇧🇷
I use to freestyle all the time to this beat lmao 🤣. Classic 🙌🏾
How did we have so many awesome black sitcoms in the 90s? And somehow I feel like I saw most of them. The VCR was the king back then. Miss something tape it.
RIP John Witherspoon 🙏
Prolly one of the hardest show intros of all time.
"We're brothers

we're happy and we're singing and we're colored.

Give me a high five!"
What is this beat?
Missed this when it use to come on fox after the news.
0:23
This theme relaxes my heart rate
2006 coming back from 3rd grade and this being on bet was door . 4pm and nothing else on but this shit was dope
Its true era . Rip Pops💙
I like the switch up and more laid back 2nd intro.
"The WB (which was nothing like Warner Bros., and UPN most likely was the original intended network) did not deserve this show"
It would be cool if it got an animated series of it on Cartoon Network
I need the name of this beat lol!! Help
Funny how certain things brings back so many memories. God bless them
R.I.P John Witherspoon AKA Pops
"Brings me back to such a fun, simpler yet stress free time."
Their theme music is how society been seeing folks of color for a min and counting
I hope we get another era similar to the late 90s and early 2000s cause this new age is GARBAGE!!!
0:05
"I wished these millennials would grow up and act more mature than they do. Kids born around this era of black excellence didn’t benefit from the black culture of that era. In fact, they actually believe black people were hated. Of course the politicians and the authority hate black people. But the rest of the population accepted them and white kids born in the mid 70s and 80s actually loved their culture and adopted it as their own. Even today the majority of poor whites who the black community thinks are racist invite black culture with open arms. It’s the elite white people who look down upon not just blacks but all people who live in poverty. But that is still no reason to hate each other. We must treat each other with respect no matter how we get treated in return. We need to have a culture of trust in Gods plan and obey His command. His command to love Him and our neighbors. We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and kill evil doings by doing good to each other. God has promised us an inheritance of His Kingdom. Don’t throw it away out of hatred towards one another. Be good in accordance to the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ that dwells in us."
man thats my fav Wayans theme song...nostalgic
That beat gives me so much hope. It’s like the melancholy optimism we were all filled with post Y2K
When I was a kid i couldn't stop laughing 🤣 at the funny theme. So bad I accidentally peed myself 😳
I miss looking at the Twin Towers when I cross the bridge.
These dudes are legends && my childhood lmao I always like episodes that this intro was on more😆
0:14
Fun Fact: Actor Omar Epps made this beat. Nice!
This was the best intro
The inspiration for that Malcolm in the middle font.
So much nostalgia hearing/seeing this theme. I loved this show and I still love the 90's... and the Twin Towers in the background 😫.
"Most of the ones complaining are the teens and young adults..... Gen Z, not millennials. Most millennials are in their 30s and focusing on family life, careers, etc."
Like a 90s baby theme
"We’re brothers, we’re happy and we’re singing and we’re colored!"
 @jaymack1374  🤪🎵give me a high five 🤪🎵
" @corduerorose9747  all right cut and print. Beautiful guys, dynamite.."
(Marlon Slaps Camera)👋🏾
 @Cw311z  glad I'm in the bathroom 🤭😁😄😆😂🤣🤣😈🔥
Just great memories during this time period....
I wish damon and Keenan could’ve made some appearances since they’re also wayans bros
the nostalgia bro
This and In The House opening reminds me of high school. Nostalgic af
This one is my favorite.
I can watch this Intro 1000 times
Dam wish I could go back in time
The first intro and this one got it
"""The wanyes bros was a good show and they didnt even get a last episode"" scary movie"
This was the best intro.
"I be feeling sad when I hear this intro fr, reminds me that I’m growing up"
White Mike
Anybody else notice the twin towers
It’s crazy how this was in the 90s when it looks like in at least 2003
I could cry listening to this
This version was the best 😎
"I use to love that show!!!

RIP Pops!!!"
This beat randomly plays in my head a lot and gives me that late 90's nostalgic feeling
Shout out to Omar Epps for producing this 💪🏾
The early 2000s still had a late 90s type vibe. It was probably around 2005 it started to feel a bit different. Technology skyrocketed soon after.
" @nebulae87  Not really, the late 90s was basically the transition into the 2000s already."
I wonder if we’re musically able
"FAX. Somebody might ask ""what were the 90s like?"" I would just show them this, honestly lol"
bout to remake that 2nd intro.. phew
I was thinking about this version too
Great way to end the 90s decade than with these two. Rest in peace pops
Best intro of this show period. I said what I said💯💯
This was the best Wayans Bros intro!
"I miss this show so much,I remembered this was always
My childhood tv show and not only that I'm mad that john had died R.I.P John we miss you  🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹"
Sounds Like a Dj Premier Beat Boom Bap
Still one of the best theme songs ever..
Is there a way I can reverse time?
I missed this show the Wayans bros Good but corny It was still good Pops will be missed forever
I love that beat
0:33 damn I’m miss that twin towers
I loved this new intro but A Tribe Called Quest was a classic as well Electric Relaxation 💯
John Witherspoon is hilarious 🤣. Just looking @ him makes mle laugh R.I.P.🗽
This and boondocks had some of the best intros in TV history
"I prefer the opening that has Tribe called quest ""electric relaxation"""
Rip Pops
My favorite one! This has to be around 1996.
This My Favorite Intro
It’s a sitcom of course it’s corny lol
Hell yeah
Jhamel Wade 1995
 @childishpaco7447  how can you think that? Over
No 1997!
Rip in peace John Witherspoon
the part of them shucking and jiving in the beginning has a deep message.. and the way they get mad at the end
My fav intro
seeing John Witherspoons name pop up is sad ☹️
Rip John Witherspoon 🙏🏽
I miss the 90s
"R.I.P. John ""Pops"" Witherspoon"
Rest up John Witherspoon👨🏽‍🦱 ( pops ) peace to wayne brothers
Rip pops 🙏🏽🥺Make us laugh in heaven 💯
"RIP Pops, you’ll be missed"
0:23 R.I.P. John Witherspoon
R.I.P. POPS. You shawn and marlon were a great team.
"RIP to John “Pops, yeetdeedee” Witherspoon"
RIP Mister Witherspoon. You were the greatest. :'(
r.i.p Pops a real Legend
"Idk why but watching this makes me want to cry. Maybe because I associate it with my childhood and a time when things and life seemed so much easier. 

Or maybe it’s because John Witherspoon passes away today. Time is so fleeting, but at least we have these YouTube videos to remind us of the good times."
"For John Witherspoon, may he Rest in Peace."
R.I.P. Pops
R.I.P. John Witherspoon! :(
RIP POPS you will be missed. Thanks for all the memories in my childhood 😢
I thought it “Yippidee”
Fa real. I feel you!
This video and your comment made me cry. I’d give up so much money just to buy a time machine and be a kid again
I thought I was just me!
R.i.p. john a.k.a. pops 😞😞😞😞
Rest in piece John “Pops” Witherspoon
"Rest in Peace Mr John ""Pops"" Witherspoon."
Rest in piece John Witherspoon aka Pops
RIP TO A LEGEND 💔💔💔
R.I.P. John Witherspoon ❤
RIP  John Witherspoon....we love you pops!!
‪RIP John Witherspoon aka Legend ‬
Rest in Paradise pops you'll be missed 😔

Sick beat bro
Super Mario Bros.
This intro was so hard !!!
2019
Finally Seasons 2 thru 5 of the wayans bros are on dvd.....gotta get all the seasons of the wayans bros ASAP....
I was born in 92 and tv growing up to me was better than wat it is now and this intro was better than the original 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"Loved this show, but it always came on early, when I was in school. I'd have to ditch to watch it."
"I love this show.

The Wayans Bros. & New York Undercover were my favorite shows as a teenager.

I liked most of the early WB & UPN sitcoms, as ridiculous as some of them were.

Homeboys In Outer Space, I'm looking directly at you."
The best intro ever.
"Peace , not piece"
This Intro was better than all the others.
Wish I could make this a ringtone🗣🗣
"Jamie Foxx Show, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Wayans Bros and Martin were the true sitcom classics."
I liked this intro alot more idk why
"Can someone hurry up and use this beat in a remix?? EDIT: nevermind, already happened"
I Know I Came a Long Way From Been a Baby To a Toddler To a Kid and Now I'm a Grown Man I Still Miss My Childhood From The 90's
Life Was Simple Back In The 90's When I Was Growing Up And Watching The Wayans Brothers Show
"Is the intro song an real song or was it make just for the show, if it is what's the name if that song"
The wayans were always ahead of the curve. They knew what was funny and knew how to push the the envelope. I wish they were still making tv and films. The last I saw was Haunted house 2. Meh
New York dudes were SO cool back then! 😍
What the name and by who is that beat ? Anyone please let me know if you know
Trippy niggas
My favorite intro!
0:20 Marlon's face 😂😂😂😂
Oh how I love this TV show and this intro......really miss the 90s
Who comes here after trippie new album lmao
This intro was phenomenal. It spit in the face of all the stereotypical shows that had came before it. And the the beat that comes later brings back memories of a life that I won't ever forget. Love this show.
I miss TV Like This
You can
Don’t forget family matters
"man Malcolm and Eddie, Living Single"
Plus a different world and the cosby show even though the creator a pervert
Steve Harvey show too.
"How dare u 4get about MARTIN, Night Court ....& Its always sunny in Philadelphia 🤦"
All of them are timeless
Paul Singleton Jr  the beat was made by actor Omar Epps back for Shawn & Marlon back around when show came out https://youtu.be/25q6JHJ-Ayw
That was Shawn
 @varunhans6110  no that 0:20
Shawn in the Liberty Staue
Black sitcoms so corny now a days can’t say shit
Why do the show a false intro and then the real thing
Even though the original a classic this is my favorite version of the theme song.
"Pretty good
Though nothing beats the original"
"Childhood nostalgia again........... next videos..... dragon tails intro, Clifford intro, and the big comfy couch intro."
This reminds me of bebe kids
Give me a hug !
CLASSIC!!!!
Thus beings back Mendes of my brother
"(Part 1 the hustle..)
Check mate check mate..
Most brothers are fake...
Don't like the N word ..
For them brothers I will pray..
Late night posted on the corner flipping weight..
Sell a lil peace of rock just to get cake..
5/0 pull up now the brother caught a case.
Caught with 16 grams of that yae!!
Remember what I said
 check mate check mate..
Do I have to repeat..
Most brothers are fake..
His homie through the cocaine his way than ran away!!

"Can never get enough of: ""We're happy, and we're singin', and we're colored. Give me a high five!"" That is exactly how they used to like to portray black people on TV. So funny!"
Who still watches this show
This was my favorite intro growing up!!
"Marlon Wayans missed an opportunity to use his new sitcom as a reboot of The Wayans Bros. He should've reprised Marlon Williams years after this show, with the kids and ex-wife. That way he could've re-introduced Shawn, Pops, Dee, and TC."
"Growing up, I caught some episodes of this show when it was on, but never really paid much attention to it. But this intro was always something that stayed in the back of my mind. This just screams to me ""90's youth"" and the nostalgia hits like a truck. :')"
What the beat for this?
What is funny is they went from a 70's intro to a 90's intro now just as far off as the 70's was to today.
I remember watching this and jamie foxx show with my pops.
"Part 2 of (the hustle)check mate!! DJ Ronniebop954
Check mate check mate..
Now lil homie locked up behind the gates..
While his fake brother homie stackin up cake..
Judge gave him ten years he was like aye.
The only good thing he only had to bid 8.
Fast forward homie tying to stay up alive.. work did real good he got out in 5. He looks up to the sky thanks the most high to be out of cage and to be alive.

T.B.C DJRONNIEBOP"
Boy a show would never get away with that today LOL. I miss The Wayans humor on tv. They were no hold barred and genuinely funny unlike what we get now.
Princella Smith lol right
😁 i know right 👍
Too bad it wont happen rip john witherspoon
"Damn, that was a great idea!"
I wish that could've happened
Its all good
Darious Coleman same
Too fire
Takes me back to the good ol days. This intro was my feel good . Miss the 90s
my favorite wayans bros. intro
"Sounds so much like a Pete rock beat. Check out ""it's a love thing "" and see what I mean"
Loved this opening and TCQs too (first season)
It'd be nice to be laid up with a girl while watching this dope intro and a funny ass episode
i like the first intro way better
Damn i miss being a kid so much. This show brings back so many memories. Makes me sad and happy at the same time
Foda
"That's a bad ass intro, east coast hip hop music video type of vibe. late metro 90's style."
Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans
I wish I was born in the 90s
I remember watching this show every morning I would wake up for school...the sun wouldn't even be up yet and I would eat breakfast and watch this show literally every morning...life was so easy back then
https://m.soundcloud.com/joseph-freiji/the-wayans-bros-theme-music
I watched this as a young teen
"By the looks of it, it seems like I'm the youngest person in the comment section."
the song is calming
I always loved the episode more if this intro played idk why lol
0:16😂😂😂😂
kcskateee crowder said nobody ever rofl
That beat
Son~Rize on Life fella release music ever is east coast music
I'm from LA and that shit is classic
Because the best episodes came out when they made this their theme song
Jordan Norvil facts
My favorite intro 👌
This got cancelled in the 90's so I caught them but I was between 5-8 when this show would come one with Steve Harvey following I believe.. this intro takes me back to when I was 16 faking sick to stay home from school.. it screams nostalgia.
You can see the twin towers 😢😢 never forget 9/11
Gives you this warm feeling of childhood. Reminds me of time when life was simple. I remember sitting on my living room floor Indian style watching this. What I would do for a time machine.
That NY BOOM BAP
my favorite of all their intros
Br ???
"So gonna sample this put a kanye flow and tell drake shit on his ""For Free"""
this intro is better
The twin towers tho
Best intro I've ever seen
do you people watch this at all
the wyane bros are so cool
has anybody sampled this beat
"This was my number one favorite show of all time and it will always be the show forever
"
super nice serie
The WB's first-ever show.
Gotta love the Twin Towers being shown so much in the background :D
how can I get an instrumental of this
Sounds kinda like Leafys outro
I know man 😔😔
yujiro hanma what's with the hate
Bush did 9/11
 @joshuarivera2005  Lol 😂😂😂
It was our government that caused 9/11.
0:33 😢
This and Martin
I feel like the only white person here who loved this show and the intro.
"Dang, I'd sit like that too in front of the tv watching this when I was  kid!"
Dominic Jordane nostalgic
I feel the same way.
Highly agree.
"Dominic Jordane 🗣1,000 Kat oms the golden era when there was an sorta Calm in the air"
I remember laying in front of my grandparents TV with a coloring book and some crayons coloring watching this....Its sad because when you think back you know that time is gone forever and all it will ever be is a memory😥
What is the name of this track!!!???
Nothing like  this man  classic
Im the 200th liker
MTV 2 every night
"When u find one, let me know. Time was golden on TV back then and I just want to relive those moments before high school."
Agree wholeheartedly. This version of the theme specifically
We shared the same childhood. I also sat Indian style in front of my tv watching this
" @jomormont3439  Kids aren't racist. They learn that from adults. This, Martin, Fresh Prince and Family Matters were all some of my favorites and it never crossed my mind back then that I was white, and they were black. I was just watching good TV."
Damn this comment hit hard
😁👍
Michael Smith might be the reason why they ended the show
Retro RockStar 9/11 happened two years later after they ended it
A TRIBE CALLED QUEST. i think
Isaiah rashad - don't matter
james pettis
what's the name of it?
d
wow u smart
Rvdy dont compare leafy to the show
omar epps made the beat..he's boys with marlon
I was four years old watching some episodes of The Wayans Bros. The intro had that New York vibe to it.
I used to watch reruns of this show everyday after school with my bro. Good times
I miss this show want this to have new episodes please 😓
lavishily nasty - 90s baby   . finally found it.. welcome
Street Politics by MC Celtic.
I want to download this theme music and i can't! 
The beat reminds me back in middle school doing homework on a winter evening with a coal fire going while its freezing n snowing outside :)
Love this NYC urban hiphop lounge beat.
Reminds me when i used to live in the city. 
That boom bap
Wish this song was longer.
"Sounds like a urban/metro/busy downtown type of beat, it figures since the backdrop is NYC obviously."
The best era in television....The 1990s had all the best black television programming...
i used to watch this alllll the time
ohhhh myyyyyy gosh
Sickest intro beat ever showed on TV
Anyone I.d. the song yet?
"I miss this show so much... ah, the '90s"
Yea they used to go high school together
Now you got the Juice lol
"Lavishly Nasty sample the intro, not the other way around."
Try converting this video into mp3 online. All you do is copy the link to this video and go here http://en.savefrom.net .
Word 😢😢
yeah..thats was like back in 2002/2003 its krazy how time just flys
+j smith This show ended in 1999
whenever reruns would come on lol
+j smith k
+Alex Nelson Where do you live now?
I forgot who did that beat and sample over. I think it was A Tribe Called Quest that did it. I gotta check
@Brandon M did you check it yet??
who plays that jam it's fucken bad ass
VicaMOOR Jackin 4 beats - Tony Rashad ... I used Shazam app to find song.
Yes!!
 @eavesDropBeats Omar epps and wayans brothers produced this beat
"@Music1990Luver sorry for the tardiness but I found a longer version

https://soundcloud.com/joseph-freiji/the-wayans-bros-theme-music"
 @DonellHussein  amazing
 @themac9677  indeed my G
Much love to everyone stay safe out here
Stanley Mcclain Right
I agree.
Still remember watching in living color with my momma after she got off work and we were eating dinner in the living room.
.skyNet The 2010s ruined everything. There was plenty of comedy in the 2000s that was dependent on race and politics...things we aren't allowed to laugh about anymore in 2019.
Stanley Mcclain   Yeaaaa The 1990s And 2000s Had The Best Shows. The 2020s Era ls Going To Be So Crappy.
Right
"Man, what you talkin' bout? LOL damn right, man! This show, The Steve Harvey Show, Martin, Fresh Prince, Jamie Foxx, The Parkers, Moesha, Smart Guy, Sister, Sister, Living Single etc. I could go on and on. Also great white comedies like Frasier, Married with Children, Mad About You, Seinfeld etc."
I Agree
.skyNet Straight Up
Yeah it had substance. Now everything is so politicaly correct
 @marlo1987sh  You Ain't Lie Dawg
SOLAR yea exactly.. nobody has a sense of humor nowadays.. just sensitive pu$$ie$.
Damn I miss it!
Does anyone know the name of the track tho?
"70s not bad, Jefferson's and good times are classics."
"Yeah, now that community is so mentally weak, undisciplined, disrespectful and destructive that you can't have shows like that anymore."
"Absolutely. In living color, martin, cosby (early 90s) living single, wayans, mr cooper, family matters, etc"
Way an Brothers were on the WB in the 90's.  They moved from station to station in like the early 2000's
This was a hot beat
What's the name of this song or were can I here the whole thing

"i know most sharks won't attack on sight but sharks still scare me, also maybe use a chest mount for cool catches like this"
What kind of boat is that?
"I copy pasted this to ur most recent vid @Finao Sportfishing hey i just came across this vid, couldnt help but 
feel bad for the shark and it seems like you guys took good care of him 
but i kept thinking isn't the shark struggling to breathe right now, so 
isnt he in pain every minute hes on the shore? It kinda seems like 
torture to the animal so i googled and apparently a couple articles are 
claiming that even after you release the shark there is a chance it can 
die just from the stress alone... anyway i was wondering what your guys 
take is on this or if you have anything that disproves those claims. Im 
just concerned for em honestly doesn't seem cool to mess with animals so
 endangered of being extinct for the sole purpose of sport, your not 
hungry and its not like there arent other viable food sources so leave 
em be"
What bait do you use?
clickbait there’s no tiger 🐅
I know the feeling dude
That is crazy
"Can anyone help me out?
I'm new to fishing and just brought a fairly cheap complete rod and sometimes the line just unravels on the reel and gets all noted any way to fix this?"
"Even though we only caught a glimpse of that beast, I still think that was so cool"
A man defeated..😿
That was nuts
At the end did he yell chat? Or “shaat!” Lol cuz if so that’s first time I’ve heard Austin cuss 😂

Avatar overuse lmaoooo
Fun fact: the draft is unconstitutional and is a violation of the 13th amendment.
Why is this even more relevant nowadays and recommended?
"X3 Me back then: “Oh, he’s not gonna win!”
._. Me now: “I swear, if he wins.”"
"I fundamentally disagree with the draft for a WIDE variety of reasons. Chief amongst them, not a a single damn person in this world is worth dying for anymore. Why would I go and probably die for a bunch of entitled brats who won't even have ever known I was alive? I'm good, let the country burn we need a restart anyway."
What you identify as?? Huh?😂
😂😂
This is basically Russia in 2023
Omg lol
Yo this shit fire
I'm good they denied me for being flat footed not even for my asthma. No I have Retina dysplasia so unless yall want friendly fire I'll stay put and hold down the fort here. Be strong on there boys don't drool too much keeping up the bit
"Bru was thinking about it and the mental picture was enough for him to be like ""Yea I got to see this Let me go pack"""
Where's my athsma pump!?
Damn it's been 3 years already 💀
brooooooooooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I spill ma weed when he said '89
"""Sir, we can't draft him. He's ret*rded sir.""

""Perfect! The Marines could use a man like him!"""
Homies with no legs or arms can still make for great sandbags
Unfortunately identifying as a woman won't work 😂
He turned into sug knight but drafting officers version
Thank God I’m a woman 🙌😭
"This didnt age well, dont forget to think about how great it was under Trump! :D"
"A bullet doesn't discriminate, against anyone."
2023
"Sure, draft people who dont want to fight a war that isn't even in their own fucking country... that went over SO WELL in Vietnam..."
This is more relevant then ever
"Get ready boys, this is about to become relevant"
Damn it’s about that time again
Zelenskyy rn
Guy probably does that whenever he wants to avoid talking to ignorant people lmao
"""It's so good, it's retarted"" 🤣🤣"
So...basically the same they did in the WW2 and Vietnam
Lmmfao this dhit is Halarius 😂😂😂😂
This would be Me 100% a Dissabled Nigga.
Relatable.
this shit  was so funny
This video is so good it's retarded!
Bro you going to hell bruh 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Na you gonna get drafted as well. Cant let unequal treatment of sexes. We strive for equal rights in the army.
 @sanjivinsmoke2719  oof
Neither does a nuke 😂
And WW1 and Korea.  A similar program was done during the Civil War (both sides).
"Not long now boys, I give it a maximum of 5 years till this shit kicks off"
I will never have the bravery to fight in the military so I’d be in prison or in Mexico if the draft came. Probably in Mexico
we want eveerybody to feel accepted hahaha equality got used way too much
With the future of ai and robotics im pretty sure we can fix him up for service
"its so good, its retarded"
Hahaha 🤣
Ahahahaha!
Forest from the hood.
"I don't see no wars when Trump was doing the thing.

Okay, a China Trade war. 

That's about it."
"""It's so good it's retard3d"""
Griffy is a time traveler. They doin this in russia
"YOU COMPLETE CUTN. How dare you make fun of mentally disabled people.
I hope you and the other GNNFOS get conscripted first."
This is the russia frontline right now
"The only thing is that it wasnt trump, its closer to be biden, destiny forbid"
Them drooling mfs are getting drafted too. Lol
"Welp...
here we are."
I will not fight a war for corrupt leaders I refuse
"Get ready boys, this about to get relevant."
"""It's Hillary's plan, dude"""
"all kind of niggas, no one left behind!"
"We got niggas with no dicks, niggas with titties that have dicks, 35 yo niggas that think they 35 weeks old, costumeless furry niggas you name it!"
Ah
Them druling motherfuckers getting drafted to. Awesome
Special ops? Anyone? Okay
Who else preparing for war with china?

Wonder if the number of women identifying as men will drop significantly once the draft starts.
Thanks YouTube algorithm 🙏
On the contrary the amount of men who identify as women will go up instead
" @Cam-Bamalam  men identified as women is already hi, with war or no war. One of them already beated the female behind in the NCAA 😂😂😂"

Does this man ever miss? Wtf man 😂

"You spelled ""Biden and his puppeteers"" wrong"
Why you change your profile picture?
First time I've ever seen you without more than 100 likes. Interesting. I'ma screen shot this special moment.
 @nicoleowens2318  Why are you thinking for yourself? Just believe the president who is obviously mentally fit.
He’s doing it right now.
 @nicoleowens2318  trump supporter
" @jksdo88  I voted for Obama twice, that’s why I’m saying it. No matter how much they’ve brainwashed people that there are only two sides, there aren’t. I’m no trump fan or supporter, just someone looking for the truth no matter who it involves. I fell for that once, twice, now I know better, and so I am not loyal to any “side,” but the people, most of whom I believe are inherently GOOD. Unfortunately, Biden, his puppeteers, and Trump, are the perfect example of what’s wrong with our society , our “rulers” are as removed from US as they can be and are delusional about their own self importance . These elites don’t actually represent us, none of them. Also, I hope you’ll reconsider calling people “Trump supporters” just because they don’t trust or believe our current president is lucid or capable of doing his job, those things aren’t mutually exclusive. It’s not an insult anyways, I know lots of Trump supporters, they’re not bad or stupid people, they’re just brainwashed and confused like you are. You are two sides of the same coin. Once you put the coin down and start thinking for yourself, that will be the beginning of understanding."
 @nicoleowens2318  bro go outside touch some grass
 @nicoleowens2318  don't watch so many politic videos
" @jksdo88  I study politics and law in anthropology, it's my field. Do go on and try to condescend me."
" @nicoleowens2318  btw now I fully support biden just because you bring politics in a normal video, I f** don't care who you support I just hate the fact that you bring politics in a normal video"
" @jksdo88  why would it matter to me, that you don't care? Or that you're so triggered by a comment that you dig your heels in to support a corrupt leader in face of opposition? Maybe you should sit this one out and let the adults talk. This isn't your post. I replied to the OP who said the problem was Russia. I didn't make it political, I simply responded to a political statement."
 @nicoleowens2318  was biden threatening Russia?
 @nicoleowens2318  did America somehow whisper to Putin to make war? Or did America threaten Russia?
" @jksdo88  yes, America did! By breaking a treaty between the two countries and trying to pull Ukraine into NATO, something expressly forbid in our contract.  Ukraine has also been bombing the towns he invaded for years, where there were mostly Russian loyalists. You clearly don't understand what's happening or why if you don't know that. How would we react if Russia was bombing Americans abroad, building an army on our border and arming Mexicans to the teeth? Especially after breaking a very important treaty that prevents war."
 @nicoleowens2318  imagine hating your own country so much that you dig your heels in to support a corrupt leader in face of opposition. Btw I fully support biden now just because of you.
" @nicoleowens2318 if what you are saying then the treaty was a joke, if Ukraine join NATO that would just weaken the power of Russia it's not like NATO could start a war with Russia"
" @nicoleowens2318  show me 3 trustworthy websites in which there are fully confirming what you are saying, otherwise you could be lying"
 @nicoleowens2318  #BIDENFORLIFE
 @nicoleowens2318  btw why are my comments keep getting deleted? Do you keep reporting my comments?
" @jksdo88  but we made the agreement. We didn't keep our word. That is the most important fact to me. You can't decide a treaty is BS after the case and do it anyways, that defeats the point in a treaty. They agreed to do/not do certain things if we did or didn't do certain things. We broke our end repeatedly first. Putin also repeatedly called for an end to the bombing of those cities with Russian loyalists in them, for years. Why would we support Ukraine at all in that case? Could it be because the Bidens recieved millions of dollars from them in the years leading up to Biden's presidency, as evidenced in Hunter's documents?"
" @jksdo88  I'm not petty, that's not how I handle disagreements, but I see your comments so I don't think they were deleted. I will say I don't need to do your research for you. The treaty was signed in 1990. I'm sure you'll find many results saying it wasn't ""real"" but that's the west covering it's tracks. That's like if you married someone and you caught them in bed with someone else, and they said your marriage contract wasn't real. Would you accept that? Don't be a fool! If you want to know the truth, you will find it. If you don't, you will keep defending people who don't deserve your loyalty. They don't care about you, and they certainly don't care about the people of the Ukraine. It's a farce to give money to the war industry. We didn't give all that money to get Ukrainians to safety, in fact, the west has sabotaged every chance at peace talks. It's not going to food, shelter, relocate, etc., it's going to bombs and guns, and therefore back into the pockets of billionaires. We did this out of greed and you're over here hashtagging ""Biden"" like that's a good thing. I genuinely feel sad for you."
LMAO this moron thinks that Putin does all of this by himself. And where is your WW3?
" @nicoleowens2318  yeah, I'm now fully supporting America for trying to bring Ukraine in NATO,  Russia just invaded part of Ukraine in 2014, and Ukraine was seeking security by joining NATO, if NATO declined then I would have been really disappointed in NATO"
" @nicoleowens2318  Yeah Russia invaded part of ukraine in 2014 and ukraine was seeking to join NATO so that russia would not invade the entire country, what bs treaty do you want to defend your country? And don't come up with speculations, speak facts."
" @nicoleowens2318  show me 3 trustworthy websites in which there are fully confirming that Ukraine bombed Russian loyalist repeatedly over the years, otherwise you are lying and coming with some bs speculation."
​ @jksdo88  you and sleepy joe need to put in a gutter 🤣🤡
​ @nicoleowens2318  Never argue with fools. They will bring you down with unfounded data. Biden is the worst president in history after all.
From spec ops to sped ops
There is something Griffy ain't telling us
Ww3 started in 2019 when governments turned on its citizens
It’s joe bidens plan
God damn that '89' was fucking funny
woke niga
This didn't age well and it ended up being Biden's plan 😂
It increased in relevancy except for the fact the presidents changed. That's it.
Joke didn’t age so well💀
well this is awkward
Ukrainian after watching this be like : o_O
If this gets recommended to you while ww3’s ongoing then you should get ready cuz shit’s boutta go down.
This shit is hilarious
0:09 seconds in and its already one of the greatest videos I have seen in a while XD
"""Mcnamara's Morons"". Look it up!  That was why Forest Gump got drafted in the movie.  It was historically accurate :("
You know the fact that I even thought about this years ago I mean years ago about Human Service in the war and using people like that I have no words to describe what in the world was I thinking back then

wer did u saw it in instagram???
Huh...the Lion and Unicorn....interesting.
"Wow....and you made that there years ago😲😎😎

Pretty ironic considering considering we almost went to war with China over at least one balloon. I think the others were fakes manufactured by the CIA"
It’s a shame Brady’s videos aren’t more well appreciated. Like he really is putting out some amazing stuff and it’s hard to find someone on YouTube to compare him to.
Balloon madness? Nobody had flown In the air before. I'm pretty certain countless people would want to experience it if at all possible. Flying! 😀
"Keith and Brady are experts at polishing the Royal Society's jewels and treasures, then presenting them to us in the most exquisite showcases and stages. Brill. Yet another brill, in fact."
"""I know know a couple of hot air balloonist I could probably sort you out."" and Kieth was never heard from again..."
that still of Keith climbing into the plane is epic!!! What a legend
Balloons are really taking off!?! HAHAHAHLMFAO Keith nailed it 100%
Please rent a balloon and fly a kite at the same time!
"Another fascinating video. Keep up the great work. Oh, and any time you want to take a break from the Royal Society, hop over the pond, and come have a look at the American Library of Congress, I would also watch those videos. I'm just saying."
Random question for Keith: (maybe an interesting video?) What is the oldest thing in the collection of the Royal Society?
2:39 am I the only one that thought of the “Black Star”? 🤓
Brady looks like he’s been on the FOT5K
"6:14 Brady: ""I know a few hot air balloonists...""
The Bristol connection."
I love Keith. I would love to see more of him.
"If Keith is also a stunt or racing pilot, I swear we need him to do a podcast."
Terminology not quite right in the video? The hydrogen balloons aren't hot air balloons. The lift is due to the hydrogen being lighter than air.
Come to Albuquerque for the balloon fiesta!
"Come on, put Keith in a hot air baloon!  Make this a reality :)"
LMFAO. Thanks.
"Great question, watch this - https://youtu.be/-vUtkAli8_U


:)"
"Is that... is that Keith in a... a leather jacket? On a biplane? But... but... but...

I know it's not what this channel is about, but more, please! We need to know more. With pictures.

Also, it's not pronounced ""helsbuy"" but ""helsbi"". Like in mostly and likely ;)"
"The drawing of the earth in a circular fashion at 4:20 is now called a ""little planet"" picture. This could be the first depiction!"

Ps. It's been too long between episodes 😉"
"4:41 if Keith had been shirtless, that could've been one of those Putin propaganda photo's!

Badass Keith! When will we hear from you on the numberphile podcast?!"
Amazing episode I only recently did just go up Helsby hill!
"Brady! You've been losing weight haven't you? Looking mighty fine up on that FOT5000 horse, mate! :)"
WE WANT A VIEDEO OF KEITH IN A HOT AIR BALLOON!!!!
I want to see Keith's adventures.
"@MichaelKingsfordGray:  Touché... which, as I understand it, is like a shower."
"In certain contexts the letter s was elongated (the first s of a double s and sometimes if an s was the start of a word). To modern eyes the ""long s"" can look like an italic f, but if you look carefully, it does not have a stroke in the middle like an f does. I think the use of the long s was in decline by the late 1700s as it was rarely used after that time."
"@Dave Sisson:  Thanks, Mr fifson!"
" @ncooty  That's brilliant, I never thought about spelling my name using the old rules for the 'long s'."
Yes! Keith on the Numberphile podcast! I second the motion.
"Yes we do, but they won't do one if we yell about it. Decorum and all that."
 @lzeph  That's a good point. Let me rephrase it: Could we please have a video of Keith in an hot air ballon? Thank you!
"Now, I know Matt Parker has done a whole bit about the probability of a particular date being at least one person's birthday given a population of a certain size, but what is the probability of releasing a video on some random person's birthday about a topic that they are particularly keen on?  I would have also taken a video about spaceflight, but aviation is my true passion and I absolutely loved this one.


Also, I liked the unusual birthday candles over on Periodic Videos."
"New channel idea: ""Keith Takes Flight"". Just videos of Keith grinning while flying in various craft."
Love the joke Keith. Lol. Dumb but hilarious. Hahaha. Thanks for making me laugh on this gloomy day.
"Brady has an incredible knack for finding people who are perfectly suited to what they do. I'm thinking of Matt Parker, James Grime, Ed Copeland, Becky Smethurst, and, of course, the one and only Keith Moore.

I've left out titles and honorifics and the like because I can't be bothered looking up exactly how I'm supposed to refer to them. No offence intended, it's just laziness, pure and simple."
Love it when Keith shows his lighter side!
Hot air balloons cost a lot more these days because of inflation.
"At 5:27, in the upper righthand corner of the map, we can observe the ""Chat Moss"".   The Chat Moss was the location of an amazing feat of 1830 British engineering.  Robert Stephenson (of Rocket fame) had to cross this enormous bog to finish the Liverpool to Manchester rail service!  A prodigious effort crossing the bog, considered bottomless, was accomplished by essentially floating the rails in the worlds first practical railway.  He changed the World!"
"That era must have been crazy. The first humans to fly using science.
Then they did science while flying.
Awesome."
"Wait up a second, just dropping in a picture of Keith Moore climbing in/out of a bi-plane with no context? Bi-plane pilot, scuba diver - Keith Moore, international man of mystery? Inquiring minds must know."
"""An aerostat (From Greek ἀήρ aer (air) + στατός statos (standing) through French) is a lighter than air aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas.""

I guess Aerostation is just a translation."

"We must be neighbors. The sky has been a dull grey all day. Considering the temp was in the upper 80s just a week or so ago, it's kind of nice to see we're still having some spring weather... still, can't deny it's quite gloomy.
Apologies and sympathy if your gloom is not weather related."
"TheLongDark

"Thanks for the info, it inspired me to read more on the topic. Based on Wikipedia though, it seems like it was Robert's son George, who did the engineering."
" @brontitall  Correct you are.  I wrote that from memory, obviously proven faulty. I thought it helpful to mention Rocket, putting it in perspective.  Still a marvelous effort by the entire firm, with George Stephenson as Chief Engineer.  After looking it up, we have Robert Stannard as the subcontractor who actually constructed the line across Chat Moss.  

There aren't many truly fundamentally world changing events, but the LMR was absolutely one of them."
"MichaelKingsfordGray 
But unfortunately they didn't manage to pass on their observations for future generations."
He must secretly be a 00 agent.
 @Thumbsupurbum  He'd obviously be a Q character with all his access to the scientific mysteries of the past.
"DirtyBlastard 
They’re called intelligence agents, which suits Mr Moore perfectly."
Biplane pilot seat is behind the passenger seat... Sorry to burst your BALLOON lol
"The name's Moore.


Keith Moore."
Aerostation is the activity you do with an aerostat.
 @kauhanen44  This precisely. An aerostation is an installation of aerostat(s).
"First i heard ""killing me"". After watching the video 20 times i only can hear ""corona"" WTF"

"God loves you. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”. Jesus Christ died for you so you could be saved from hell and live in heaven with Him after you die, and all you have to do is put your faith in Jesus Christ, that He died on the cross for your sin and rose again from the dead on the third day.  Repent of all of your sins, and be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Believe in the Lord God Jesus Christ, and your name will be written in heaven! Jesus is the only way to heaven.

Man your killing me
Who hear corona is deaf
"I heared ""kill me"" no ""killing me"""
"I hear killing me initially but some how hear Corona as an after effect, so in a sense I can hear both ... if that even makes sense, like my brain initially processes killing me, but some how processes Corona 1 second after hearing killing me. Same idea as how when you spell washing detergent or a candle, there’s an initial smell, but then another smell is also sensed after the initial smell settles."

"I hear ""Kay oh no"" ""Kay oh row""  or ""Kay row no"" Which I guess is closest sounding to Corona, but it's really a stretch for me. 
It's mostly the ""Kay"" at the beginning instead of ""Cuh"" sound. If that's supposed to be Corona it's a complete butchering of the pronunciation."

"I'm a grown ass man. I'm a college graduate, I'm married, I own a home, I have a good career. There's no rational reason why this video should make me laugh... and yet, it did Alex. It did. Apparently poop and fart really isn't dead. I think that I too believe in love again... my wife is going to be so happy. Or disappointed... yeah, probably disappointed."
I love you
Thank you for showing the struggle that many Americans deal with everyday
Would love to see a full length parody of God's not Dead like this. That movie was wack. Amazing job as always ❤️
"Ahhhhhh a classic. I love the redemption arc for the teacher. He starts off hating the jokes because his mom died from  gastrointestinal illness. But at the end he's redeemed when he gets hit by a car and dies but everyone laughed at him because he pooped himself.

What a beautiful movie with a message <3"
The fart noise was unexpected and made me laugh.
Tell me why i choked on my breakfast 🤣😂
"This was so good, so good that I cried, maybe pissed my pants and maybe I shidded and cummed"

"Update, 13th April 2021: I've been told that some conspiracy theorists are, bizarrely, circulating this video as fact. To be clear, this is speculative fiction from 2018, part of a sci-fi series on this channel. I thought that'd be obvious, but apparently not. If someone has sent you this video as ""factual"" or ""a plan for the future"", then you should know that they're either a) malicious or b) entirely disconnected from reality!"

The specification that this is 'a' future and not 'the' future is oddly extremely important
What a nightmare

Remember when this was a joke and not a geopolitical paradigm?
Isn't this based on that one Blackmirror episode?
I never knew you made these futuristic (or terrifyingly likely soon to be) world situations through stories. Love them! Both as a thrill and as an heads up.. geez we really have no idea how society will be like
Don't they already have this in China?
"This is fascism. They control you by force. You cant say anything otherwise the people in power will destroy you. talk about ""freedom"""

I sometimes wish I was born in the 80s or 70s because as I'm 17 I haven't even started life yet and already we can generate videos, music and art with computers, along with the rise of radical LGBT people ruining kids too (Not the normal LGBT people, you guys are cool).

"How the hell could people take seriously a video countaining ""if you are a citizen of Google or Facebook""? 😂"
"Ahh, that explains the recommendation of the video... Some people are dumb."
How did that happen
China's been doing this for many years by the way.
Was wondering why this was tossed into my recommended.
"Not surprised that delusional conspiracy theorists actually used this video as their ""material"".

They really lack basic critical thinking skill."
Lmao
how did you make this so realistic ?
“1 day ago”
Poe's Law strikes again...
"you wouldn't happen to benefit from this, would you?"
Meanwhile in China...
Or c) both
Then why has China already adopted this system? And want it worldwide?
I'm glad you told me this
" @lilsmiley7756  China’s been planning their system since 2009. This video is probably based on that, but if it was in the UK."
"I mean, technically they are right if they are talking about China"
"2018 - amusing Sci-Fi 
2021 - harrowing prediction
2030 - my social credit score is low, so I must dislike and unsubscribe from your videos. It's nothing personal; honest!"
 @shikoba4055  it’s from the future... you don’t know if they are now their own countries 👀
"Not gonna lie Tom, I don’t even know what you’re talking about right now. My social credit score has been 92 for the past THREE DAYS, and I won’t let your government conspiracies about this being a hoax ruin that streak. Good luck with your social credit score, 50er."
 @shikoba4055 like a lot of SF it's not that far fetched
 @risymian3374  not really. I've found they use the same tactics as the government. I question both
Something scarily similar to this is in china. Right now.
Expected from theorists
 @WorldofTomorrowInc  It's in the playlist section as ⏩
 @shikoba4055  the same way that pushing someone of the edge of the flat earth is real.

Oh. Si This Is why youtube recommended this to me.
Why are people so ridiculously stupid?
3 weeks ago and already 40 replies
Why am I getting notified of every reply on this comment?
It was recommend but its not far off tbh. Vaccine passports are on This slippery slope.
"I mean, this is a thing in China now. It's ridiculous, so It kind of is fact but for the wrong country."
It is a plan for the future. Look up agenda 21. Agenda 2030. I am disappointed in you Tom. I thought you were intelligent.
c) Chinese
"This is almost actual fact though, just in China."
 @tsilb  in a China . The other three Chinas are safe for now.
";) You posted that disclaimer just to stop the hemorrhaging of your Social Credit Score after PregerU fans started sharing it. Just kidding. Please, FB and YT, don't lower my SCS, I don't mean to suggest that SCS is a real thing or that I'm believing there is any validity to this whatsoever to this video."
"This speculativ fiction comes very close to reality, what we can expect. This might actually become reality within 2 years."
"It might be speculative fiction in the Western world, but last I heard China took it a bit seriously 👀"
"Also, Biden 2024"
I still dislike bogus conspiracy theories.
So a complete fiction that looks frighteningly similar to the new reality being rolled out before our very eyes as we speak.. hmmm.. makes me wonder what the motivation behind and the intention with this video is??
"Well Tom it would seem that you have been closer to the mark than you thought. 
Oh and your video just popped up, go figure eh…"
"Regardless of however fictional that this video is, it does seem increasingly likely that becoming a ""Paper's Please"" society with a Social Credit system could happen. However, there is absolutely no need to be concerned about it, because world leaders will always have the best interests of the public at heart."
This is going to be the future though unless people stop it
wtf what mor ons
 @danielyoung5059  i spaced that just so i don't get filtered
It's a little less of a conspiracy theory every day now. Soon it might even be censored by YouTube... the only arbiters of truth.

Seems like xi jinping has seen this video
but is it really that big of a jump from what china is doing with sesame credit?
"Or option
 c) Referring to the direction China has steered to."
"China has already implemented a social credit system, not nationwide, but in some areas. Laowhy86 made a good vid on it."
we do a little tomfoolery
"You might want to look into what's been happening in the west right now.

And you might want to read into what happens to whistleblowers and stuff. Especially those working in intelligence, government agencies and big tech.

tom everyone is making memes about this
with how the country is going i wouldn't be suprised if this video actually became real
"Considering what is happening in Australia right now, It's no longer farfetched at all to say that this is actually something that's happening in real life. The people you indignantly call malicious, out of touch, ""conspiracy theorists"" were right all along.
The fact that you seem so adamant and passionate about smearing people's character/intelligence is making it painfully obvious that you are running damage control for elitists who have a narrative to push. Don't strain yourself now, Tommy."
 @lanadoesathing  based
When you hear that China exists
 @ste45  np they are not.
" @alexmackay7454  this has only been proposed in china. Trust the guy who made the video, idiot"
 @aarongorton1984  no it is not
" @tinfoilhomer1535  no, shut up with your conspiracies you eggplant"
"""Entirely disconnected from reality"" seems like projection, if you really believe it."
It's not that much of a stretch as there are already plans to tie in carbon credit scores with the Covid pasport (if you have flown on a plane you can't buy meat at the super market for a while). It's a short leap from that to a fully fledged social credit system. Given the readiness in which most people seem to accept restrictions without explanation I don't think there will be much protest if a Chinal-style social credit score was introduced.
-69420 social credits
 @risymian3374  oh really? China has had the social credit score for years. Other countries are pushing more and more control over their citizens and it won't be long until this gets introduced in other countries. You're the conspiracy theorist here if you think the government doesn't control everything
>inb4 vaccine passports hit
Or both at the same time. Being malicious doesn't exclude to be disconnected from reality.
"C.) they're chinese.

Also good video +15 social credit for you."
lmao a bit more true than u think
" @GoogleDoesEvil  Unless you live in China in which case it is much worse, much much worse."

dude this is china
or you know BOTH
fictional unless you are a citizen of China
 @risymian3374  Funny yoi say that. When China has the same system for a while. It is reality. Just not in the EU yet.
I am not even surprised anymore that stupid people on the internet think this is real
" @artmannify  oh look, one of the conspiracy theorists!"
I guess fiction is becoming reality then
😶‍🌫️
"Vaccine mandates and passports were called a conspiracy, too, now look what's going on in NYC and CA. How many conspiracy theories have to become conspiracy fact before people wake up and see where this is headed?"
"Aaaand china got those now, what a surprise"
"This is ""a future,"" china has this now and acts like whats said in this video. Wtf china watches your vids"
We need season 2 of this
"I like how Tom Scott, someone with a very professional diction, can call someone disconnected from reality with an exclamation mark. It's like insulting someone with a proud smile."
"didnt know just how close this future was, eh?"
-100 social credit
 @risymian3374  yep
 @rogen8094  conspiracy theorist found
 @IAmPancake  well it's china
Lmao I'm glad you're awarr
Dutch parlement is talking about this tho. So its not purely fiction anymore also china is doing to all thier plebs now for a while
We perform a little malicious activity
"To be fair the rise and fall of the Social Credit System as an social control mechanism have a lot to do with the rise and fall of monopolistic tech companies of China, especially Ma Yun of Alibaba. After their clash against the traditional Princelings faction of the CCP (who, obviously, would only want family heritage and bloodlines as the sole criteria of social classification and feel social credit system more as a nuance than a benefit), the technocrats fell from power during the Pandemic and that brought to the end of advocations of the Social Credit System."
"It’s true, just not in England. It’s being introduced in China. Additionally you can’t criticize the government"
i am really sorry to disappoint you Tom but we are heading this direction…. China is already doing this (kinda).
China lmao
this did not age well lmao
You gawddamn did it now zhonghua is doing something
It’s fact in China
"ayo this is litterally 1984



no joke it is tho"
"Idk Tom, as a citizen of Google, while also having a passport for Facebook, I feel that this video may sadly be my future!"
yea ok buddy
 @alexmackay7454  nah hes a libitard unfortunately
Ask China - they took this a bit too literally
In China it is
This video is aging TOO WELL
"""or b) entirely disconnected from reality!""  ......... you're in for a big surprise sooner than you think"
....who's gonna tell him?
 @Ozymandias1  Source?
 @turborooster8548  Do you have a source for that?
" @aarongorton1984  look. You look at least 30 years old, and from school you should’ve learned that china and the us are different. Boohoo, if your not vaccinated, you can’t fly on a plane, big deal. You have something called a car. Just get the damn shot and then you don’t have to worry."
" @hczylos2432  You are spouting out nonsense. You do not live in China. Biden is a centrist. If anything, you should be worried about Trump. Not the frail old grandpa who is not a fortune teller"
 @sangheili333  no they weren’t
 @fireworkstarter  any proof for that claim there bucko?
" @Louca1  Sorry to disappoint you, but you are not in china"
 @jnbr7520  I think you fall under that b catagory
 @PigIA  how about you check the news? The debates are open too you can check everything what hase been discussed and all votes/wich parties voted for them. Where is your search history bucko?
" @shikoba4055  It's funny how it was just a joke, and yet now we're having discussions about giving mega-corporations a seat at the U.N. and holding them to nation-state standards..."
It may not have been factual... but this genuinely is going to happen/happening now with jab passports.
And I wondered why I got this recommended...
Make this video again in Chinese and boom its factual
china
"I thought this was real tbh
Seems like something that'd happen"
It’s coming buddy
 @lanadoesathing  Based
 @katze8955  it is in china
"People in here really believing entire China is like this... China has the social credit system only in very few cities so far even though they wanted it to be a full thing already in 2020. People seem to often misunderstand that it's only a very small fraction of China that somewhat uses this system.

It doesn't make it any better though and it will surely be implemented in the rest. But people are blowing it out of proportion all the time like whole China had this system or even worse. Just wanted to clear things up"
 @zombor8249  -15 social credit
"This video is entirely factual, aside from the location."
"Well, yes and no. This kind of thing exists in China. And with the general lack of thought given to privacy and how easily people are manipulated into giving up their rights for some alleged safety (terrorism, not COVID), it's just a matter of time."
" @alexdawkins5368   nah, it aint."
"You are assuming they will be logical enough to even check this info, Scott. I don't know about that."
 @JoePCool14  just get the shot
It’s becoming a reality you dope
"it is a reality in china though, we had better establish this one."
phew
Doesn’t this exist in china
i would belive this if it wasnt for this cuz well china has something simular already so why wouldnt other countries do it
How did you do that? Tell meeee now
laughing in Chinese
"Well, China certainly thought it was a good idea, maybe you should clarify that with them"
Okay gangstalker
Not so sci-fi anymore...
what about china
"the reason is probably because of recent china memes, where this video is accurate"
Isn't China is doing that?
Imagine this video is used if they actually implement a social credit score
"Thanks for the preview, chap."
This is literally how China function Tom!!
"Stop and think for a second; How disconnected from reality are you, that you would accuse others of being disconnected from reality over a topic like this. Do you not live in the real world??"
It should be obvious but vaccine mandates were a conspiracy too so...
China literally does this
I mean this is exactly what's happening in china
":You're a wizard tom
:What?
:A wizard"
"This is why we need a social credit system, so we can know who these people are."
ㅤ
"this is not even fiction, in china people have a secret credit score."
I China they experiment with this idea.
"You probably should have ""Read Description"" in the title of this video."
The vaccine cards may as well be the start of it.
"They've already implemented an incredibly similar system in China. ""Pro government views"" boost your score and get you rewards ""Anti government"" brings it down as well as brings down the scores of everyone around you. Deputizing the social construct into government propaganda."
"I am once again disappointed by humanity, the fact that the description wasn't enough to make it clear that this was fiction is well......
sigh"
To be fair they have this in china
Then why did you make the video?
Bing chilling
Wow I am sure this fictional video is just as made up as the department of community and culture.
Top 10 mommento before disastero
isn't this already reality in China?
"Tom, How big of a chance do you estimate that such an social credit score system will be implemented in europe?"
Scott you know they'd put this in place if they could don't lie
"I saw this from my friends a long time ago, I thought social credit was a thing in China, was I duped?"
 @shikoba4055  Facebook wants a place in the UN.
The sad thing is that China has already implemented such a system…
 @norinko7224  same youtube is malicious
"Hate to break it to you, but this is definitely a model for the future. That's reality."
"If you don't think something similar to this is planned for the future, then I'm afraid, my dear Tom Scott, you are sadly the one that is entirely disconnected from reality."
 @danielyoung5059  I hope that's sarcasm
It's real. I already got my Facebook citizenship.
They probably would have a low social credit score so this wouldn't be a problem!
"C) If a friend sent you this, it might've been a prank."
"monkaW i love the ccp, tom scott + 1000 social credit in china"
And then came the memes
"I mean it's honestly weird how accurate this is for China's social credit system, or maybe it isn't, you've taught them your ways, and now they know everything."
Bizarrely? Really? Have you been paying attention AT ALL?
"CCP: ""Oh Tom you sweet summer child."""
I thought this was completely real and was freaked out
giving ideas to china?
Speak to you in a year.
its becoming less theory
 @danielyoung5059  Your funny. Best interests at heart that's a good one
 @sangheili333  All of them
Funny because it’s a thing in China
 @engliships2126  I have half seriously theorized that the timeline of the universe is based on a circular pattern and if people actually start moving to the US because they dont like Europe it could possibly prove my theory to be true which kind of scares me
These people need there social score reduced smh
"disconnected from reality

Reality: Chinas been doing exactly this for years"
" @scienceium5233  not a conspiracy theory at all. Actually happening in China. And saying “well it’s China” is a brainless take. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere. Not a fringe conspiracy to say that."
China likes this video 👀
1984
This is fact in China and it’s what authoritarian scum want to implement. judging by how right conspiracy theorists have been the last few years I think I’ll pay attention to them from now on!
"Well, it's real in China so you never know"
... then you should know that they're either a) malicious or b) entirely disconnected from reality! Either way we strongly recommend you to report them on our new social credit app.
laughs in covid passport implementation
Or Just A Troll
thanks for clarifying
"What do you mean by ""reality""? Well, everyone has their own reality inside their minds..."
"19th of October 2021...no longer fiction, conspiracy theorists no longer a conspiracy!"
"Wait, why are Scotland and the eu the ones who care about privacy?"
This is unironically really close to reality. I have absolutely 0 doubts this could happen in the following years
 @shikoba4055  corporations are asking UN for a seat to Amazon and Facebook. This dystopia could be more real than it was meant to be
China
It's coming soon though....
-500 social credit
"China already has a social credit score, in the US people with wrongthink even with nothing criminal, get their bank accounts closed down. Now half the world is demanding to see medical papers to access supermarkets. Of course this video is not fact, but it is a lot closer to reality than it should be"
"This is already factual in China, so why would you try to make this look like some kind of fictional play? If someone would do that with dividing groups into classes and sending people into gaschambers and say the same thing, you would not agree, because it is sick. And now you pretent this is somehow normal in a future?"
Authoritarian hell
What do you think a vax passport is? It's a social credit system with only a single condition attached to it. Do you think these won't be expanded with additional conditions? Do you think we go from 0 to 100 overnight? They'll introduce these things one at a time.
Social credit score is a real thing in China
China does it
@tom: can you please explain the social score system that is in place in China?
"I literally thought this was an introduction for Chinese social credit system which recently ""came out of beta"""
 @risymian3374  this is real in china..
Here before 500 replies
"I'd say it's only a matter of time when (not if) this becomes real and is dubbed ""the new normal"" worldwide"
C) Or from China
"well I would just use one word 
""china"""
"Intended as satire; rapidly becoming too close to the truth. AKA the ""Idiocracy effect."""
This is real
"Actually Tom you should know that this is well on the way.  But keep hiding your head in the sand, you'll learn soon enough."
They're either a) Trump supporters or b) Trump supporters!
You're just saying that to increase your social credit score!
This is just an episode of white mirror
What about China then?
6uild 6ack 6etter
Or so the Germans would have us believe
"I mean this is happening, right now... in china."
" @risymian3374  yea, because this is so far fetched that only an idiot would believe it... Or maybe the Chinese who are actually living it"
This is happening in China rn smart ass
+1000 social credit points
"And if b is true, their social credit score will be decreased lmao"
or c) just trolling
 @sangheili333  I mean that's just not true. It's not a conspiracy if it was public information that the ideas were being discussed in terms of their effectiveness to get people vaccinated. I watched a video many months ago taking a zoom survey of random unvaccinated individuals where they asked how many people would get the vaccine if they needed it to fly. Most people who otherwise said they wouldn't get vaccinated said that they would if that was the case.
 @JoePCool14  public health issue. It's literally in our constitution. Plus if you're not concerned about getting Covid then you shouldn't be concerned about getting the vaccine bc it's literally just 1/26th or something of the Covid Virus.
we'll see ya in a few years when this is actually correct and you sit here acting like it's preposterous
"Lots of people think this is happening in China, ironically being the exact misinformation the western governments make them believe."
"Recommended Oct 19, 2021. PS I would say if someone sent this as a “plan for the future”, they are “entirely Connected to a Very Likely reality”."
"can't wait for the ""conspiracy theorists"" to be right one this one, like they have been so many times now."
"I'll come back in a few years when it becomes true to tell you ""i told you so""."
wait a few years and this will be true
Absolutely nothing bizarre about that.
 @5uperM  You will own nothing and will be happy
 @ulrest437  lmao no you took the joke too far
"China is literally doing this rn. It's not a stretch to see it as fact, though I'd expect riots if implemented like that in the west."
Nah fan this is as factual as the moon landing 🥴
Someone has never heard of China then
 @alexdawkins5368 It's certainly true in China
Still gonna wear my tinfoil hat - just in case
Are they really disconnected from reality
"Damon people who share this false info should have a lower social score, we need to know who to trust."
"I have to say, I live in Brazil and we have a system similar to this ficcional one presented (credit score - serasa score) that ranks your ""good payer"" levels, and it just take into account your behaviour, not others and does not affect how the goverment will treat you. However, if the ""vaccination passport"" proposal passes, things will start to incline to this fiction, at least from my perspective, and this is scary"
actually it's being done by china rn I think
Epic
"Not at all, Tom"
"Video: *not the future just a future""

Idiots on the Internet: *I'm ginan pretend I didn't hear thay"
"This is where we are heading now, no doubt about it. Visionary video."
 @133col  I dont think so
they are trying something like this in China
 @shikoba4055  they might buy a cavity country? Effectively what Amazon are doing in Cyprus
"well they use it in china, might as well exist in the west"
 @hczylos2432  yes so decieved its alrweady happenign in china m8
but why?
"This FICTIONAL video isn't aging well, meaning that it's looking scarily accurate day by day. Tom, you might want to distance yourself from Conspiracy Theorists, but they have a good track record the last 19 months of predicting what is going to happen."
you should've put that disclaimer in the beginning of the video then...
Or because its getting closer and closer to real world implementation
Does Tom Scott being part of your social circle help or hinder your score ?
Huh.
 @risymian3374  especially when it refers to Scotland as currently being in the EU.
" @ste45  mate, what do you lose having to confirm your vaccine status that you don't already let Google or Facebook know willingly?"
"IT WOULDNT WORK - As it relies on the country's laws to make sense and the public to be in agreement with them. This is not the case with prohibtion of psilocybin, cannabis etc (also why give a very Conservative government bad ideas Tom. You know they can't tell the difference.)"
"You are departed from reality, if you think that this isn't an almost certain part of our future. Thanks to weak, ignorant people like you, Tom, our society is doomed to be even worse than George Orwell's worst nightmares"
"This is real in China, but if they’re saying it’s currently occurring in the UK that’s be, there’s plenty of actual tyranny, I don’t know why some people need to go making up incorrect examples."
"Repent to Jesus Christ!!!
““Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:19‬ ‭NIV‬‬"
It's literally already happening in China. Why do you think it won't spread?
" @bobongleizi5179  The alternative is this though. Or more rather the current, it's just not as obvious outside of China."
"I mean, China did it"
" @hczylos2432  yep this. All the big names I respected on YouTube are turncoats. All perpetuate the lie to keep subs and views coming in, disgusting. The hodge twins don't though fair play to em they are calling the bs out."
Well this is speculation but well...
"Thought to myself, at last, a spider is going to get some payback against a frog, after seeing those abhorrent videos of some dickhead feeding his pet frog."
"The spider also didn't need a large lump of flesh sitting in the middle of her web, attracting attention to it's presence to other possible prey items. Just good web management if you ask me. 😄"

That was very unexpected. Nature is truly awesome
What if that spider could fly. :face-blue-wide-eyes:
So it is official. Spiders are better than people.

This video is epic.
Wonderful
this is one of those get a taste of your own medicine situations.

What reason does that spider have to be that big
Idk it's golden orb spider
"Spider: ""Ok, finally something to eat. I havent eaten in days.""
feels out the frong
Spider: ""....What the heck is this thing?"""
"Evolution saved the frog. They evolved toxic skin for that specific reason- so they are less likely to get eaten. Evolution also saved the spider. Spiders do have something akin to a sense of taste, and that sense may have saved the spider's life in this case."

"That's amazing. Nature might seem cruel sometimes, but in reality, it's just pragmatic."
Lesson learned: when you caught people in your web... Eat them.
I’m happy for that spider 😁😁👍🏾
W spider
"spider: aw dude why you gotta mess up my web
frog: my bad bro"
Well being a poison frog probably saved him
Should’ve killed it. It’s competition :/
how do spiders have better problem solving skills than some people
😯😯
This dude bit Peter Parker
wait how did the spider detected toxicity without dying !?
Thank God the frog is alive
oh spiders have mercy??
WOW !
😳😲😮
Nooo not the frog noooo
Holy crap that is one epic spider!
As humans we think we are so superior but even a spider acts more human than we do by not harming something that it is not going to eat. I am not saying all humans hurt animals but how much waste do we throw out and pollute also.
Be the spider
Seeing that creepy spider setting the frog free it's the nicest thing I've seen in a long time! I felt so good and happy :)
That's ONE strong web to hold a frog. I would be scared to the moon if I ever walked into one!
yay!!!
"Good thing the frog escaped at the end, or else this would've been sad"
生き延びた
"Nice , this gave me a different perspective on spiders , maybe they're not so bad after all."
"This spider is a lot in the garden behind my house, usually in a tall tree, not the type of spider that attacks, I have a video when this type of spider walks on my hand"
"That was great, to see the spider help the frog out of its web.
Even if it was after it tried to eat it."
"beautiful gesture of the spider, but some human threw the frog into the spider's web. Like all documentaries, scenes are forged."
"That's what I call a docile spider .....that's pretty cool. I really thought the spider would have just left him hanging to die. The spider Definitely lives by "" with great power comes great responsibility"""

That’s the real Spider-Man

This is one of the most amazing videos I've ever seen
That plot twist!

This line touched my heart"

dem spiders be smart dow
Wow that was pretty cool. I didn’t think the spider would cut him down at all lol.
Well it's not that it doesn't want to harm the frog but it doesn't want its web to get further destroyed and occupied without a reason.
How a spider can be so smart to judge it can free a pray wtf lol
"Dude, that's kinda nice."
this spider is way more humane than the talibans and isis

They threw the frog into the web. Sad.
"the spider wasn't being nice,  he just didn't want that homeless nasty poisonous frog on his patio."
Subhanalloh..binatang
I can also see life cycle of narcisst😁
"Had to cut it or else other animals would see a spider web 
There doe"
"Whoah, he literally cut him out and let him free?! Never seen anything like it"
OMG!! IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY!!!
Is the frog dead
"Frog: don't eat me please, my family needs me
Spider: did you say family?
Frog: dom toretto?!
Spider with dom toretto face: family is the most important thing, I got you man"
So she just lets it go. Very interesting!
SHEESH THE SPIDER JUST RIPPED OFF THE WEB TO FREE THE FROG-
How dare you not go along with the presented narrative.
and that's is how boys become bros with just a simple tap tap.
This made me feel a type of way hearing that ys as humans are 1 out of i think 3 animals that kill for fun .
Humans take notes . This is just another example of how nature is so beautiful
Meanwhile in my backyard blackwidows kill lizards and dont eat them. 😏
"Wow ,,, that arachnid has deep sense of maturity."
spider: stranger danger stranger danger
Really fascinating
what spider is that?
Take notes human beings.
"Suara speaker is ""sengau""."
"I believe the spider didn’t want it on its web because it’s toxic and generally a hinderance if left. However, I could be wrong. I hope I am, for the worlds sake! 🌎"
I can’t even lie.  I was NOT expecting that
If you know anything about amphibians you know someone obviously set this up. Zero chance a random frog is just hanging out in a flower bunch in broad daylight. Zero. I won't even mention the astronomical unlikelihood a camera was also there to capture the moment.
Sir if you're not here for business then I'm going to have to escort you out.
Nature....f'd up
people 'should' learn from this spider...
"Frog can eat spider but spider can't eat frogs.
Spider: so i took it personally"
Even spiders have morals
Moral of the story: fill yourself with venom and people won't kill you
"Ive never seen anything like that before, that was amazing."
I'm guessing the lizards are a potential predator of the spider.
Do you mean to eliminate what is of no use to you and destructive to one's food trap?
"spider is like ""bro you taste like shit gtfo my web"""
What?! That’s a first
"Poor frog 😪. There is nothing I can do, that’s the circle of life."
Omg i didn't know spider is so smart he know how to set free frog they have brains lol
I have been alive 43 years and always amazed I can learn and view something miraculous every day.  The spider was like I have a Gluten sensitivity and father is coming over for tea at noon may as well get rid of this rift raft that is dirtying up my humble abode.
"""Not even a spider will kill for pleasure.""

"So I’m a Spider, So What?"
Wow-what an intelligent spider!
This is the same spider that let go the poisonous tiger butterfly. This spider knows the right food menu.
"Spider: You choose the wrong web fool!

Frog: Hey hey hey its me carl chill chill!"
The spider's choice is natural...if the prey is not useful...set it free.....Wow!!!.....even the entire humanity on Earth can learn from this tiny spider....
Wow!

Why are these always ruined with awful narrators?
"1:31
1.-How did the spider knew the frog's skin was poisonous?
2.-How did the frog survived the spider's bite?
3.-How did the spider survive the frog's poisonous skin?

These are the questions."
Has the frog stopped screaming yet?
Answer to all 3 . she took a shy  tiny bite to test and then withdrew because she could feel that this was not safe
Never thought id see a chill spider
the sequel:  the frog eventually ate the spider.
"Remember, Professionals have Standards"
"animal is amazing. They are well designed ""robot"". To some extent, they are more rational than human being."
we should be more afraid when we meet a human than when we meet a spider!
"The spider isn't being nice or humane. It's doubtful it has the capacity for compassion or empathy. It's merely being practical by keeping it's web clean: unless it can eat the frog, it's compromising the effectivity of the web. So it does the obvious thing, by getting rid of what amounts to a large piece of debris. It would similarly remove a leaf from its web."
Spider went eeww
Imagine if that spider was just lonely and wanted company but bit kermit for too long and he died. 🤔🤔😂. Least he had a good meal from the hoppy fukr 😂
This is the exact reenactment of Spider-Man Vs Reptile
Empathy? Ethics? Or just the equivalent of throwing bad food out that is stinking up your house instead of eating it? The spider did the only thing it could—get rid of the foul tasting thing that was screwing up its web. I doubt ethics entered the tiny spider brain at all.
"Best about this spider is, his webs are gold color"
So cool!!
"Spider: Ey yo, I realize you ain't food, so I'mma cut this and you go, ok?"
The spider knows he couldn't kill MLG frogs.. gonna give him a piece of doritos.
wow spider help forg
Spider: Time to eat babyyyyyyuu
"Spider :Stay Quiet 
Frog : Got trapped and "" Why do i hear boss music?"""
"frog: ""CALL AN AMBULANCE!""


""but not for me...."""
Wow a spider has more intelligent than some humans.
This is beautiful. Although the looks of spiders frightens me this makes me love them even more! 😍😍 Wholesome content
I can't believe spider has a heart too
"Title must be "" How the Spider free the frog from the Web"" 😂"
"Frog: Looks like we have a draw.
Spider: Whatever just get off my web."
i love that
these ladies are sweeties i keep them as pets :^]
INTERESTING
the undeserved morality high people get by repeating bs slogans/ ideas is hilarious. “not even a spider kills for pleasure” so pompous and the idiotic. many many many animals are cruel without the intent of survival. dingos hunt for sport . many animals eat without killing its prey. dingos hunt and kill strongest looking animal of a pack wothout eating it. many animals eat their young in order to allow the female to be fertile again. to act like nature isnt cruel is so pathetic and terribly miseducated.
dingos kill fpr sport and plenty other recorded animals also kill for “pleasure” i am so sick of the bs lie that only humans are so cruel as to kill not for food. whoever says this is ignorant to say the least.
He released the frog what a top guy
Thatz Crazy Yo 😎
Whats the name of the spider?
Professionals have standards.

The way the spider dropped the frog was like someone throwing away nasty trash

Amazing video. Animal kingdom is a lot better than that of humans.
What you will do if you found those kind of spiders?
"Wooooow even a fucking inscet knows it, when we will learn???"

That spider you just saw is only 4.5 inches (1.5 without legs) . And its big enough to eat a small bat
And a Goliath Birdeater and a giant huntsman is 12 inches! (4.5 without legs) Just think about that."

I was expecting the spider will eat the frog
Mondrzejsze od ludzi
everyone praising this spider for not killing it seems super silly cause if you think about it the spider cant really inject its venom into it without great harm to its self so logically it cant really kill him even if it wanted to and on top of that it had to get him off his house/feeding net rather then pick up and move it just detached him from it so its not that he showed mercy he just had no other choice...
0:28 - 0:36 “.... exactly in the path of this little frog”.        Crew member later throws frog in the web. 🤣🕷 🕸 🐸

Turns out the frog ended up offering the spider a huge job
GET OUT OF MY HOME STINKY BITCH!
Amazing long leng spider 🕷
Omg 🤨... she saved the frog
"I once tossed a green anole lizard into a spider web of one of those spiders.  She pounced on it, bit it, and wrapped it up for later consumption.  The next morning the lizard was still mummified and dead in the spider's web, but the spider was dead on the ground underneath the web.  I guess lizard blood disagreed with her.  :-("

Spider has better ethics than many of us
"Um, how exactly does the spider know that the frog is poisonous? Did the frog whisper it in its ear?"
"Ugh why do people like to twist nature to make it seem like animals have morals? No the spider wasn't releasing the frog bcuz hes nice, he didn't want a fucking frog messing up his net"
"Humanity, sit down, watch and learn !"
The frog is too heavy so it fell
Amazing creatures!
I think the frog was poisonous. That's why he let him go
damn maybe i should not smash angrily every spider i see. maybe just smash them nicely instead
"It's more of ""Get the fuck out of my house"" than ""Oh i cant eat you so have a nice day"" btw"
I bet that frog wont jump into another web ever again lol

"People says that insects doesn't use their reasoning... but this is the perfect proof, meaning that people is wrong in them thinking."
"""Nice spider""? So, watching animals kill each other is ""beautiful""? What does ""natural"" even mean? It is Scientifically Proven that the Earth is an Irregular Plane (Irregular refers to the Lands, which have elevation and deviation. Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level), which is created because of Intent, Intelligent Design. If you want to watch a quick video to sum all this up, it's explained phenomenally by a Scientist (Realist) known as Del: https://youtu.be/TXWAMyLb-xs and also: https://youtu.be/pKYywPYJfWo

Here's why:

First of all, remember that Science DOES NOT belong to any institution. It DOES NOT belong to a particular group or person. It belongs to every single human being alive.
The ones searching for truths according to the type of the claim become Scientists. People searching for truths also become Realists (Truth Seekers). Science means exploring the inner and outer surroundings of ourselves.

There are three different types of Sciences:
A) Natural Science
B) Formal Science
C) Social Science

Social Science deals with people and their behaviours. Formal Science deals with Mathematics and it's assumptions (Mathematics is a language, which means that we can create anything and make it mathematically correct, but that means NOTHING in real life), Natural Science deals with Objective Reality (The immediate or physical reality). If someone claims that something exists in the Objective World, OTRMDPPs are needed for that claim to be Scientifically Proven. OTRMDPPs means Observable, Testable, Repeatable, Measurable, Demonstrable, Practical Proofs which MUST be verifiable by every single human being alive. Without OTRMDPPs, the claimed thing is considered pseudoscience, or a belief.

I now shall ask the question ""What is the shape of the earth we stand upon?"" and then immediately proceed to look for OTRMDPPs. I found out that some lands are elevated (Mountains), some lands are deviated, some lands are level. We can then conclude that the lands are Irregular in shape, which means not all lands are elevated, not all lands are deviated.

The next OTRMDPP is Water. Water is abundant. It is the second most important thing for human beings to survive (number one being air), which means that every single human being alive has access to it. The bodies of water are largely found in Oceans. I then found out that the bodies of water need a container to stay still (stand). If there isn't a container, I found out that they will flow until they find the lowest point to stand upon. Bodies of water stand, if there is a container, which means we can call them Standing Bodies of Water. I then found out that Standing Bodies of Water are always Level (Which means no elevation or deviation from the starting point to the end). If not messed with in any way (for example the air pushing the water), Standing Bodies of Water are also perfectly still.

I then tried to pour some water in a completely sealed rectangle shaped container, this did the trick. The water then starting to fill up the container until the very top. If I pour any more water, it will flow away.

I then measured it to see if it was perfectly level, and to my surprise, it was perfectly level without any deviation or elevation. Obviously water is the MOST perfect tool we got to make something level. Water takes the shape of a container.

I then got an idea to use a sphere. I started to pour the water onto the sphere, but then the water flowed off from the sphere immediately to the lowest point, that tells me that Water DOES NOT conform to exterior of shapes.

There is also ANOTHER OTRMDPP. The floor cannot rise to our eye level if it were a ball, no matter the size. Because spherical geometry makes it impossible for floor on a ball to rise to our eye level. Watch this video for more info: https://youtu.be/o3jX96TVy5s

With the help of OTRMDPPs, I have concluded that the Earth is an Irregular Plane (Irregular refers to the Lands, which have elevation and deviation. Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level).

I will then ask another question ""Did something create this world?"". After searching for OTRMDPPs, I found that anything, be it dirt, or water, or rock, can't be created from thin air, stuff cannot pop out of thin air, not even randomly. With the help of OTRMDPPs, it is Scientifically Proven that this world has been created by Intelligent Design. There is absolutely no other option. This world, the entirety of it, is infinite. Because if there's a starting point and an end point, what created the starting point and end point? Then what created the one which created the starting point and end point? Where is it located? It's infinite regress. Only logical solution is infinite. Sure, our lives, the physical world may have a certian finite feature, but the whole thing, the primer mover, has got to be infinite, eternal. Watch this video for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/P3-1GrBTTdo

Now I had some curious questions, ""What about the sky? What about the two light things that move in the sky? What about stars that move in the sky at night?""

Before we go any further, I want you to remember about two more different things when it comes to the Objective World, the Intangible and the Tangible.

Intangibles are those objects which are not in our immediate reality. For example, If I see a house far away, I cannot measure how far away it is or how big it is, I need to get near it first.

Tangibles are those objects which are available in our immediate reality. For example, I am typing this article on my iPad, which means that I can touch it, I can observe it in full 3D. I can rotate it around completely to touch and see the whole shape, I can measure it, I can also interact with it.

The sky is Intangible. The Moon is Intangible. The Sun is Intangible. The Stars are Intangible. OTRMDPPs are NOT available. Every single capable human being should be able to reach the sky and OTRMD with Practical Proofs the things in the sky in full 3D, if not, we do not know what those objects are in the sky, and trying to come up with ideas about what those might be are nothing but assumptions, ideas, beliefs. We live ON Earth, not IN the sky.

Now, OTRMDPPs tell us that because this world contains Air Pressure, there is no other way, this world is CONTAINED. OTRMDPPs tell us that this world is CONTAINED in SOME way, we do not know the shape of the container. But without a solid container, Air Pressure is literally impossible, I'm afraid.

TV Screens, hearsay, white coat guys talking nonsensical mathematical equations are NOTHING but beliefs and mental thoughts, TV Screens are NEVER going to be concluded as Scientific Proofs, the things shown in the TV Screens are NOT PHYSICAL.

Last but not the least, one last question ""Why are things falling downwards?"" Well, the way things fall has NOTHING to do with the shape of the earth. ""But Gravity!"" What is ""Gravity""? Can we OTRMD with Practical Proofs? NO. Is it a magical pulling force which allows some things to fly and pulls down some things to make them fall? Can two objects come closer without some sort of push? ""Yes, in space"" ARE YOU THIS STUPID? We live right NOW, on EARTH, not in some magical fantasy land! In order for two objects to come closer, I either have to push one object to the other from the front, or push the second object from it's back to the front. Motion is ONLY created if something presses on something else. Pull is just a term for push. Things that weigh more than air fall down, things that weigh less than air float.

If you want to go deeper and ask why do things even have weight, we have to first explore the whole earth to get a good understanding. But if you're curious anyway, I suggest you watch this video: https://youtu.be/G05dl2BenKE and this: https://youtu.be/XJ11coI7mas

""Why does it matter? I don't care about the shape!"" Well, I will address you some important questions, ""If the Earth is an Irregular Plane, why are these governments lying?"" They're lying because they don't want people to explore the world and find out what's out there. ""Don't you want to know about your existence, the purpose of life?"", they gave us a 2D map, they're showing the map everywhere, and people are accepting the map WITHOUT exploring the world! How can we verify or falsify a map without physically exploring first? We are trusting governments as if those corrupted psychopaths are our mom and dads! Do you like being imposed by strangers? All the governments are CONNECTED.

If we have the truths about our existence, about what created this, about the whole place, we do NOT need religions, philosophies, beliefs. The majority of people are in debts, some are poor, and some are incredibly and suspiciously rich... then HOW IS THIS A GOOD SYSTEM? The government is imposing it's subjective version of what's good and what's bad on the whole world and people are accepting it? You don't want equality, compassion, love, respect? If a person kidnapped ten people and he's forcing them to do things with or without their consent, he automatically becomes a criminal. What's the government doing? BOTH ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING, IMPOSING! THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION HAS STOCKHOLM SYNDROME!

I'm not associated with anyone, I can only represent myself.

"For all the clowns saying the spider is more humane then a human, stfu , it released the frog because it wasn’t useful and it was taking up its web space smh"
actually a lot of mammals kill for pleasure
meanwhile in australia
When i want to live with my girlfriend
"""Weeeee!""
""Bob, stop jumping around. It's been the third time this week I have to free you from the web... you such a dork seriously.
Now you free, go find a job and try to keep it for once""

How Thoughtful 😂😂😂
both are paid actors for documentary purpose
Spider name?
Moral of the story 89% of ppl in comments and the narrator are dumb
"Frog fell to Spider's Web
Spider: WT--
 Frog: Uh-oh! I just slipped
Spider: UNDERSTANDABLE, HAVE A NICE DAY"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! Father!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This looks like the scene where the protagonist falls in a trap of an edgy character, and the edgy character releases it and says: ""Never come back here, this isn't a place for kids"""
Is that loki?
Awww.Lol. Lots of love
What spider even is that?
"After watching episode 1 of ""So i'm a spider, so what?"". This is good"
That’s amazing
"Frog, after jumping onto web: *are you friendly*?"
"What spider is that,  it's beautiful but also made of nightmares."
Ayo Kermit.. you good?
That’s crazy
amazing scene !!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know why this touched my heart so much
Dang that's a biiig spider
If good morals was a spider 🕷️
The spider was like “ I don’t eat vegetables”
"That species of frog would never be in that location... set up,, so spider is like wtf is that"
Based on how old this is it’s safe to assume all actors are dead.
From a Spider that let go of a Toxic Tiger Butterfly to a Caterpillar that eats a Plant-hopper to a King Snake eating itself to a Fishing Spider catching a fish and now a Spider that almost eat a Frog 😱😱😱
"Just checking if this is real from the latest anime, seems true though."
"Not even a spider will kill for pleasure

KUMOKO VS ELRO FROG
KUMO DESUGA NETFLIX ADAPTATION
"The spider released the frog to keep the net clean trap and no insects see the frog and then avoid the net. It’s not about, i cant eat it, then i release it. The frogs are spiders competitors  for the resources and if this spider had the choice, then he would kill the frog.

This is the real justification."
why spiderman release frogman
"""If the prey isn't useful, set it free unharmed.""
That's why we set our exes free unharmed 🙂"
Spider : wait a minute !! Nope ..not for me !
That spider is going to heaven
Kumo desu ga in real life
Just the humans and the dolphins kill for pleasure... pretty sad
Wow very nice i have two Spiders 😍😍😍
That's why I love Spider-Man
Join Bugtown at @t! It's a new invertebrate server. I hope to see it grow and expand soon! See you all there! I really hope you'll enjoy this!
"yeah, the only reason the spider released it unharmed is that getting near that frog would poison it. otherwise, the spider doesn't really care if it's left alive or dead."
What is the name of the spider?
This was so beautiful 😂😭
Did the spider just cut every string of web to let the spider go??😳😳
"thats what humans do to each 
other these days"
wow that Orb weaver Spider is intelegent and smart.
"It’s amazing how the spider untangled specific strands of the web to set the frog free. It not only can weave and traverse, but also analyse the web."
See nature's not so scary after all!🧐
It was fun throwing sticks on a giant spider's web during my childhood days and the spider just cut off the sticks that got caught on it
"I like how the narrator assumes the spider, or should I say “nature”, has an altruistic side. I’m pretty sure things in Nature kill for sport on a regular basis."
Humans could learn a thing or two
"prey falls

Spider:finally  a break-oh its you"
was the spider big ? or was the frog small?
i was looking for this comment. tho i didn't expect to find it so soon. the first episode just came out and all i feel is hype.
"So here's the unsung brains behind Google.  ""Do recall having interned at Google back in the '00s a young greenhorn from Cal Tech."" 🕷️"
"1. Humans came from nature as animals, too, so it's not absurd to assume there are different sides to other animals in nature as well.
2. There is altruism in nature. Vampire bats who know one of them has gone hungry deliberately vomit some of the blood they drunk to save the hungry one from starvation."
"If he kills it he will die too, the skin is toxic."
Now I'm truly sorry I killed a black widow.
That moment when the spider has better morals than most humans
"Frog tube : Saved by a spider 
Spider tube : I save a frog which got stuck in my web"

charlotte;s cousin
"""This look weird, better taste first...
Holy fuck, you disgusting creature, get the fuck out my web!"""
...and don’t let me catch you hoggin’ all the flies!
"The only creatures that kill purely for pleasure is our own species. Other carnivorous mammals don't: cats will play with rodents and other small animals they catch because they are honing their hunting skills. Foxes, coyotes and other canids will go on a killing spree if they get in to chicken coops because they find themselves in a prey- rich environment, and their instincts get overwhelmed. Even then, what they can't eat, they will try to cache for later, when food might not so be readily available. I don't count creatures such as invertebrates (with the exception of cephalopods, whose intelligence has yet to be fully explored), fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, as they tend to live purely by instinct.
 

It's only our kind that go out and kill other creatures, just because we can, and because it gives us a sense of having the power of life or death over other living things, and that gives us pleasure.  I don't like my species very much, and I often feel great shame for the things we do to both others of our kind, and other lifeforms."
Spiders like “gtfo my web bro!”
"""Set it free unharmed""

Frog: BOI! don't you have any idea how High I fell from that Web.."
I think i heard the frog said 'martha'
As someone with arachnophobia.. I wasn't expecting to call this huge spider cute
Even these tiny creatures are so  humane...but not we humans 👌👌
bealtiful!
thats amazing
"that's one wicked spider. What is the species? I could not quite get the name........    never mind, found it. Ya gotta love Google.  Nephila clavipes"
How can the spider set it free if  unharmed  the spider already bit the frog
wait what kind of spider is that?
if the womens do that....
"Nephilae keep their web clean from objects that will give away their traps.  After the spider decided the frog is not edible, the former simply proceeded to get rid from the latter.  Spiders like that are practically blind.  Notice how it carefully investigated the intruder (predators can lure them by acting like prey) first by plucking the web to get info with the vibrations from afar and then proceeds to touching to make a final decision."
"The spider doesn't feel any remorse or compassion, it simply wanted the frog out of its web. Don't read too much into it's actions."
Realtalk....I didn't know a spider can do that
And it gets  another day in this fine stance of nature for another prey to come
Great 👍!
"Spider: I'll now attack!
Frog: I activate my trap card!"
So unhuman

when the spider realize that the frog is his  homies never seen in a long time
😱😱😱
This is so god damn wholesome
"Bcoz the frog is too much poisonous to digest , so the spider let the frog go. He's not the human being who killed the others just for mental pleasures.."
"Plot twist: that frog was a suicide bomber who came to kill spider species

"Wtf!! That’s crazy 

I feel a bit more compassion for spiders now

Except camel spiders for sure"
"Araña:¿Bob?

That was nice from mr spider 🕷
He just said the spider doesn't kill for pleasure which is true because it doesn't.
No I'm sure they just happened to stumble upon this rare event while filming for their nature documentary in the forest.
came here after an encounter with a large ass toad and a house spider in our bathroom
"LOL that spider is clever af, she knew the frog was poisonous so she let him free. Nature is so wise."
Bitter taste
"Cute Spidey 🕷️

i remember frodo.... what a frog
David's linguistic precision is bliss to my ears.
You can just see how relaxed Lee is as he leans back knowing he gets free shots at David.
No idea how he pulled her. Obviously intelligence no doubt
We nearly watched their marriage collapse!
"Just had a thought, would he say it was true if it was..."
The odd couple both are vile
"I love the look on Victoria's face when David said ""Victoria doesn't know this..."" and then her reaction when David said ""I go upstairs and move her bookmarks""!"
Must say that I always liked Victoria Coren… until I saw her god-awful cry-wolf accusations of racism about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe that she played out in a (miserable fail) effort to destroy Leo Kearse over the course of an interminable stream of thinking-impaired tweets. That was a bit of an eye opener!!
Victoiria doesnt kow much to be honest.
Another example of the female comedian oxymoron.
"I love everything about this, knowing this is pure love…love to see the happiness 😍"
David is an incredible wordsmith. So quick and sharp!
hes punching way above his weight
Mitchell you beauty.
"Just the sheer, unbridled fury on her face."
They’re so Fuckin cute 🥰
Victorias reaction at the start was brilliant. You could see she was reacting as if she was genuinely shocked to be have heard it and was remembering a time it had happened. Brilliant reverse poker face
"""I still find you an adequate colleague."" Is basically David's, ""You are my rose."""
Nobody's going to comment on the fact that Victoria reads seven or eight books at the same time?
Victoria is rather yummy
"It's pretty funny watching insecure men in the comments keep saying things like this. Maybe one day you'll realize women find all sorts of things hot. Personally, I'm here watching for that very reason!!"
"She's a television personality who does lots of interviews. SHE HAS to be reading several books at a time. It just comes with the job! One day, she interviews an actor...with a book to promote, the next day, she interviews... Stephen King! So again, yes, she has to be reading several books at a time."
A lot of people do that. Not that unusual.
"There could be several reasons why someone could. 7 might be because each day of the week has a different book, like watching weekly episodic television episodes.

It could be that the books are read in different scenarios, non fiction isn’t great bed time reading (harder to switch off when learning, books for different rooms, books for learning new skills. Mood also plays a role, there are books that have pretty intense subjects.

Or, if you are like me, you have ADHD and it’s a boredom thing"
This is the best clip ever. I've watched it many times and can't help laughing at the quick wit of all the participants. David and Victoria belong together in the best sense of that sentiment. Long may their marriage thrive.
"Even though David is witty and charming but every time it boggles my mind how quick Lee Mack is with his replies. Has to be one of the sharpest minds in comedy. The only parallel, I can think of is would be Joe Wilkinson."
AWH! Haha that was great
This is a CLASSIC. I cant help but laugh every time I watch it :D
Love the chemistry 😂😂
Awkward? This is hilarious!
I adore Victoria Coren and David Mitchell
It's not awkward - they're all mates.
She’ll probably call him a racist now
Did Siobhan Sharpe write this clickbait title?
Victoria's face at the start when she genuinely thinks about if he might be doing this.
"Whatever this is, it isn’t comedy. Incredible that people pay their TV license for this gush."
clickbait much?
My god Victoria's reaction was too perfect!!! Then again she is an expert Poker player. Totally thought it was true.
I just love to watch this clip every now and again... And again!
Clickbaity title
"I've seen this clip soooo many times, but when it pops up as a suggested video to watch, I'm drawn in every time."
I want to see these two on QI together!
david literally talks like i imagine a real - life spock would😭😭
The best couple.
I always wondered who she was when I saw her on game shows loo
"David's face while Lee is going on and on about how horrible it would be to move bookmarks had me thinking for a moment he'd done it. He genuinely looked very guilty, as if he was just realizing the weight of his actions."
I think there is a deep deep friendship between Lee and David... you can't give someone else the amount of shit they give each other without the respect...
"""Oooh, I'd put it between 6 and 9.""

Nice"
"""Victoria doesn't know this""
Victoria: this is going to be interesting"
These two should have been on taskmaster together 😁
The only time she’s funny is when she talks about David and his wit
"Ohhhh so that’s how some one with zero sense of humour or wit getting on tv?!
Gotta be the most boring unfunny person on the show."
So what happens when the lie the tv show has made up for you happens to be true? 😳
Of course if it were true then that would mean David actually told the people behind Would I Lie To You with the express intention of revealing it to his wife in exactly that way. Which would be...well just sociopathic enough to be in character for him if he was feeling more perturbed than usual.
The ‘Clinton Card’ comments shows how light-weight Lee is...
Victoria is smoking. She has that strict teacher vibe
"Is VCM not the ideal woman? Beautiful, funny, clever, doesn't take herself too seriously. So many fantastic qualities. She's lovely."
"Moving bookmarks to get someone to doubt their sanity. I'm glad it's a lie.

Doesn't that behaviour come under gaslighting?"
0:15 I love the look on Victoria face is like David has just admitted he is having an affair.
The adequate colleague/Clinton cards exchange shows exactly why this is a legendary cast.
David Mitchell didn't kill himself.
I think David and Victoria seem to have the same logic when you see them arguing there case on points you can definitely see the similarity in the way they reason things. Having said that I really really want to see a reaction video of David watching Victoria on Taskmaster.
Omg the stakes were so high!!
I love the expressions that play across Victoria's face as David reads the card from beginning to end.
"But, she doesn’t know how to look up the weather for herself."
Bull description
Clickbait title much? :/
These thumbnails are getting wild
"""He doesn't hate me, right?""

The silence in the pause with the whole world waiting for the answer.

And then the very fake ""Nooo"""
"How can David take a such a bland semi-compliment, and make it so patronising? 😂"
"The way she looks at him while he was ""ranting"" about the weather forecast thing."
He’s punching well above his weight with her
"""David, are you still writing for Clinton Cards?"" - just brilliant!!"
She's literally more than twice my age but I just find Victoria really attractive.
That clinton cards joke was hilarious
BBC please learn on how to put a good title. Have more class ffs
The comedic chemistry between Mack and Mitchell is pure magic.
"I love them,"
At 1:39 I swear you can hear Jimmy Carr laughing in the audience...
"""Weaker and weaker..."" lol"
They really are the best together 😂😂😂
Hardly awkward.  Clickbait title.
Is it normal to be reading 7-8 books at the same time?
What if he lied about lying?
David can do better
"Nah, just a desperate attempt to get the last word in, as usual from Lee."
What's happened to Victoria's fainting fan and David's lollipop man video?
Victoria's face when David reads out the card is wonderful.and I want it framed
"Things I'd like to have seen this episode:
""Alright. David, you're up.""
......
""Okay. I once had a snog with one of the people here on 'Would I Lie To You' tonight.""
....
[cue angry glare from a certain someone to his right]"
"I can so relate to they way David and Victoria up the anti. Very funny. They need to be wheeled out together more often, but the downside to that could mean that Lee Mack might get his wish after all.  Lol."
"In a just world, David and Victoria would be the #1 Power Couple."
1:40 that sounded like Jimmy carr's evil laugh... Didn't it?
"There;s a much better c lip when Lee tells David he and Victoria have been texting each other behind David,s back. Mitchell plays up magnificently"
Hardly an awkward moment
She is so out of his league. And if that's true when they're fully dressed imagine them naked.
"David would never have done it, but it's exactly something Mark Corrigan would."
"The epitome of the new trendy term ""Couple goals"" these two."
David Mitchell is one lucky man
"Why does she have 7 or 8 books on the go?! She goes back & forth, reading a bit of each?!"
Only thing I find unbelievable is that someone can read 7 or 8 books at a time.
You could see every book she's read recently flash across Victoria's face in 2 seconds
Normal marriage.
"Great segment, no animosity just fabulous quick wit from all. Brilliant, clever & so funny 👏👏👏"
"David Mitchell had them dark pupil only eyes, the eyes of a psychopath..."
Not awkward at all.... just funny
She. Is. Beautiful.
Which episode was this?
That isn't odd. I'm currently reading 6 books at the same time. Fiction and non-fiction. Depending on time of day and what mood I'm in.
better than looking at her old man
"1:08

I want a woman to look at me like that while I'm being pedantic."
"Hello,
Please Look At The ( 1:08 ), Part In This Clip,
Can Somebody Tell Me, Has James Corden Had Cosmetic Surgery ????"
"I, for one, really thought he HAD moved her Bookmarks. Hmm, what does that say about me? All I can say is that I'd never do that to anyone but, strangely, I've done worse. C'mon! We've all done worse. :-)"
"David Mitchell's face after the ""clinton cards"" comment explains exactly how much David likes Lee LOL. <3"
"""Well, he might find out."""
"Victoria at the end, watching to see if it was a lie is the best"
One of the best exchanges of humour from this show. The 'Adequate colleague' bit was top draw.
David and Victoria are perfect 😂
"So adorable that when David was trying to weasel out of answering how his wife can annoy him, Victoria actually answered for him to get him out of it."
"I love the 7-8, 6 and 9 bit 😂😂😂"
Victoria is Jewish never mess with Jewish women.
You could call this “does David move Victoria’s bookmarks?” And leave the click bait.
"Bullshit title.
Clare Balding was spot on. He worships her."
"Okay!, now I know that David Is not gay,"
The awkward moment when there is nothing awkward in the clip. 🤦‍♂️
was it just me who heard Jimmy Carr’s laugh somewhere in the video?
"WILTY needs to come up with a lot more of these kinds of cards. 

The audience reaction was going to be really involved no matter what the answer was. ""It's a lie"" and you hear a cheer of relief. ""It's true"" and the place would have lost its shit. That's the best card you can possibly get, but that also probably comes down to David's ability to lean into it and make it seem plausible."
0:51 - 1:09 David kills the room twice in a row. Many standups would kill for that wit.
"""Victoria doesn't know this""

This voice in my head went ""yet"""
Would a BBC video title lie to you?
 @trollop7153  lol what?
 @roamphetam1ne  I presume you're responding to something I was obviously not allowed to say. What was it?
Victoria gives him an admiring stare too after the second one. I love their relationship
"I know this would technically fall under gaslighting, but honestly...... this would be a HILARIOUS petty mostly-harmless thing for David to do 😂😂 like just the 1 little thing to get a zinger in once and a while lmaooo."
"It is sad but true that, amongst those who care about such things, the fact that an intellectual, slightly insecure (i apologise for the phrase) wimp can end up with an equally intelllectual, gorgeous, talented and winning poker player, is a cause for immense joy."
The couple that improv’s together...
I wonder how many people move bookmarks after the airing of this program
Was anyone else legitimately relieved when David said it's a lie?
"victoria how many books are you reading 
7 or 8
david how many books is she reading
i'd say between 6 and 9

Genius! haha"
"Thumbnail is a bit extreme, isn't it?"
Brilliantly funny and scary if it had been true
What's with the title?
BS title
"You know everyone likes this clip. Everyone was thoroughly charmed and amused by it. Everyone who clicked the link knows what they're looking for.
The clickbait, tabloid trash title is therefore completely unnecessary."
"Lee : Victoria, how many books do you read at a time?
Victoria : Umm maybe 7-8.
Lee : David, What do you think, how many books does Victoria read at a time?
David : I will put it between 6 to 9."
"When I felt like my husband was cheating on me, I hoped it was not because I loved him so much and that the signs were clear enough, but I was sure he was cheating on me, I did not have access to his phone that time so I tried to use youtube to watch videos that would help me read messages from his phone without access but there was no breakthrough. I ended up contacting this hacker, after seeing several recommendations on here about him. Believe me, I got what I needed. That's why I recommend him 24hrshackservice.C0M. He's very fast and reliable. Let him know that Melissa referred you"
"I have been noticing my wife cheating on me but i dont have enough proof to bring it up against him so i hired 24hrshackservice.C0M , they did a perfectly great job for me and i never regret meeting them, Cause they are the best."
"I used this to monitor my son to see if he was going anywhere before or after school as I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t going anywhere I disapproved of. I was able to do this quite easily using the GPS tracker and I was quite impressed with the accuracy of the locations. 24hrshackservice.C0M delivered as promised, the GPS tracker and being able to see his messages and call log was extremely useful. I had an issue with the GPS tracking for a while and after contacting them their solution solved the problem. They got back to me very quickly and their advice worked. This exceeded my expectations and is better than anything else I have used. I would definitely recommend it, 24hrshackservice.C0M"
"24hrshackservice. com are the best, i dont need to stress myself cause they have show me they are the best many times"
"For his sake, very relieved 😅"
It was a reference back to an earlier round when David claimed to have been a temporary lollipop man.
"the reason why many are on this page is probably trying to figure out the best way to access another person Instagram , Call logs and a lot more.. well it is very possible but i dont feel a seven minute video will get that done for you.. it wont be that easy, especially when you are not a Savvy or know how on cyber difficulties.. well, i dont you need to stress much when you can get a Guru to get the job done in a limited time.. You can get in touch with 24hrshackservice. com they are  genius."
"I have been noticing my husband cheating on me but i dont have a prrof to bring it up, Not untill my sister told me about 24hrshackservice.C0M"
24hrshackservice.C0M help me to track the location of my stolen phone and that give me the access to know the thief
"I will be forever and ever grateful to 24hrshackservice. C0M, they help me track and get back my lost phone"
Don't join the rest of the plebs with clickbait titles bbc.
"What I've always wondered is, couldn't they just say something was true or a lie whether it was or not? Nobody's going to be fact-checking them, especially when it's regarding a story from the past. Dave could've just said it was a lie to save his own."
"David Mitchell has the most unsettling eyes.  Kind of like doll's eyes; All black and lifeless,"
David's comedy was on fire in this segment!
what a crap title
"Lee is only joking, I think that the title isn’t right"
Chabuddy seemed quite put on the spot this episode.
They have the most adorably posh relationship. So sweet. Agreed with everyone else on the title of the video.
One of the best episodes
2:16 maybe his wouldve been to tell her she cannot put lipstick on to save her life :)
Sounded like Jimmy Carr's laugh at 1:42!
Well he just doesn’t does he
"01:39

Is Jimmy Carr in the audience?"
And....i wish victoria was my wife for 24 hours.....
This is such an abysmal title
Is everything just clickbait now?
"""Victoria doesn't know this..."" well lucky it's a lie because if it was true then she definitely knows now."
I just searched who David's wife I've is and i feel totally different about him now. I knew she would be intelligent but didn't think she would also be beautiful.
David and Victoria are so perfect for each other...
Anticlimactic.
"Hmm...twould appear the BBC is playing WILTY with us, the audience, with clickbaity titles like that. Evidently it was indeed a lie."
This show is consistently hilarious. British humour at its best.
"Good clip 

Bad title"
David Mitchell should do a prank show! Hear hear! 😂😂😂
That first look on Victoria face as her brain processes if this could be true is priceless.
Mark didn't get Sophie or Dobby but David sure lucked out
"Davida wife is much better looking than I would have guessed.
But he is a bery successful comedian and seems to be a good guy. 
So in a way it does make sense."
The intern that runs this channel sure knows how to write generic clickbait titles.
God this episode was great. Up there with the Big Narstie episode and James Acaster's cabbages!
Not sure if Lee ripped into their marriage ????
"I don't care about the title, I  enjoyed that.😊"
"So many of us are invested in David and Victoria's marriage -- we want them to be happy with each other, overall at least."
"I've never liked lee Mack , he's one of those tossers that needs to humiliate ppl to appear funny which he isn't. Watch him on 8 out of ten cats alongside bill Oddie and see exactly what I mean."
Dislike for shit title
Bait-arsed title!!! These guys bounce off each other every time...not awkward at all.
"""I once bought a horse..."""
Overall. Jerry Dungarees son?
" @smokeupsomeG  Okay, you got me -- I'm American. But I adore David and Victoria nonetheless, or none the less."
Does any other person think Victoria is an incredibly sexy woman..Cos she is :D
Gosh that was funny. They're so cute. 😂 I feared it was true because that is an awful thing to do!
Lmaooo David is amazing.
"""I'm emotionally invested in their relationship"" she said, but she was the voice of a lot of us."
David Mitchell and Lee are both extremely sharp and perfectly compliment each other. Genius pairing.
"That was brilliant, I was squirming"
"sure, THAT would be an awful thing to do. Firing your assistant because he didn't see the funny side of it, now that would be nothing but just."
The crowd cheered at the end 😂
Not awkward is it
The moment Vitoria’s face dropped after David finished the sentence!
Same sort of non-biased BBC titling that Boris Johnson likes...
"That was a nice moment when David really didn't want to say anything even slightly negative about his wife, and she helped him out with the weather thing, essentially giving him permission. It was funny watching him try to deflect the question though XD"
Please rename this video BBC
"At 1:48, Rob is basically going, ""Daaang, girl, I'd be so much better to you than that."""
Where was the awkward moment?
anyone else wanna pound greg james
"“Is it fiction non fiction?”
“Yes those are the main two”
That’s some good quick witt right there"
You've got to put them in separate rooms if you're going to interrogate them
Is Rob reverse ageing?
"you can see it's actually true, but he just couldn't do it, look at the stress in his face as he declares it a lie, there's an actual worry going on there"
"I am too! I don't often get invested in irl celebrity relationships but David deserves to be happy. After all he waited 3 years! And Victoria is lovely, she is funny, witty, smart and a nerd. Just like David."
" @janesmith699  I agree with you. I've never met them, I never will, and I don't particularly go out of my way to watch them, yet I am just as emotional invested in their relationship and wish them nothing but the absolute heights of happiness."
" @janesmith699 , what did he wait three years for?"
" @_JohnDoe  to finally be with victoria! they were friends, she was dating someone else and david was in love with her haha"
"If being married is avoiding things and waiting for permission to say or do stuff, forget it. I'm staying single."
 @PrincessTheGuy  David didn’t want to say anything specifically that upsets him about Victoria. David has said in his life story that he spent a lot of time searching for love and he has an enormous deal of respect for Victoria. Sure it might be a little much but he’s nervous. And understandably.
" @PrincessTheGuy  He's just trying not to publicly embarrass her by calling out her faults on TV. He's not whipped or anything, he's just a gentleman who cares about how she feels"
" @PrincessTheGuy  If you want to go into a relationship just plowing ahead doing whatever you want whenever you want without a drop of consideration for your significant other, I’m sure any potential partners out there are quite fortunate that you have now sworn to remain single."
 @jeffmansfield914  and I'm happy being single too. Everyone is happy 👍
Also the types of things to bother David are likely to be a bit mad
 @jeffmansfield914  Would you be interested to write for clinton cards?
" @jeminmehta7353  
Sure, send me an offer."
"For God's sake. He worships the ground she walks on, and she does the same with him. They've both said as much repeatedly on live tv and radio. That's why he doesn't like being nasty about her unless she gives him permission, and she doesn't slag him off, either. 

Just be happy that they've got something rather wonderful."
" @PrincessTheGuy  if you wanna air your private relationship on public television, it’s better if you stay single."
"Yeah that was really nice, she really intelligently gave the crowd what they wanted knowing that David wouldn't want to risk embarrassing her on tv even in comedic mode and gave him a route to a safe topic he could be comfortable being funny around. It's so subtley done."
And Webb at home going daaang boy u better not have done that to me!
he learns from Lee lol
 @justbecausegaming2143  You underestimate David's intellect
 @homemail9653  you underestimate lees ;)
the pause is possibly edited out
 @ComradeSpookfessor  or maybe these guys do comedy for a living so they naturally become quick whitted when having been on featuring panel shows for so long?
" @justbecausegaming2143  not at all. Why can't they both be equally, but differently great, intellectually."
" @homemail9653  what? what are you trying to disprove? i dont understand what you are on about?  i said they probably didnt edit it out, they are just naturally quick whitted because they entered a profession and then mastered it over time? dont have a clue what you are on about"
" @justbecausegaming2143   simmer down , don't get your panties in a knot. I was responding to you saying I underestimate Lee's intellect, hadn't seen your other post."
My favorite line. 👍
 @justbecausegaming2143  it’s their wit which allows them to be a comedian. Comedians don’t learn wit. It’s a natural ability.
 @homemail9653  my mistake i didn't realise
" @mmmcfc9332  thats rather philosophical of you to say, if you want to go down that route then i say yes you're right people are born with their natural talents but they dont just come out the womb cracking one liners here and there, they have to discover it over time and to discover it they'll have to do a lot of learning before they discover their abilities. either that or you get lucky enough to discover it randomly"
What do you expect? Hes spent hours out with Lee Mack
 @justbecausegaming2143  Damn. I just wrote a similar comment lol
" @justbecausegaming2143  definitely in Lee's wheelhouse, that joke"
 @homemail9653  David started copying Lee's style when being quizzed midway through the show's run.
" @justbecausegaming2143  oh I agree it has to be nurtured and that would happen as they grow up depending on their influences, people they’ve spent time with growing up, family members etc. my point was more that you can’t really teach wit, certainly not to that level of speed. As you said people are born with natural talents, they still need to be nurtured for them to show"
" @ActuallyJamesS  just like you haven’t seen babies knocking 30 yard free kicks in from the pushchair. Doesn’t mean the talent isn’t there. If being a quick thinking witty comedian who is genuinely funny was easy or could be learnt by anybody they’d be more common. As it happens, they aren’t and Lee Mack is up there with the best. Certainly in Britain anyway. That’s why this show is perfect for him, it’s made me view him in a different light as I never really liked his stand up."
I think they are both geniuses.
" @justbecausegaming2143  why would that be underestimating Lee's intellect!?
""learns from Lee"" - really don't think so."
" @achjetzt  it was just a comment chill out lol

david and lee are both very smart. Lees just smarter when it comes to making a joke given very little stimuli. whereas david, whilst whitty (cause thats what comedians do its their literal job), is smarter academically"
" @justbecausegaming2143  chill out, lol.
I don't agree that he is."
"He got hair plugs, having a thick head of hair really makes a difference!"
Nice save.
This sounded like a marriage counselling session
I love to see couples arguing . You just know that when they make up their gonna have a really amazing shag
It's become my favourite show!
I loved this romantic novel. Lee and David at first at odds with one another and at the end found companionship. Bravo.
"I think the weather forecast anecdote was true, though."
One of the best WILTY bits ever.
"3:06-3:08 Guy on the right is visibly annoyed with Lee’s contrariness and constant interruptions that pass as humo(u)r. I gotta say, I’d personally much rather be on David’s team."
I'm glad to be wrong
Who wouldn't
remember seeing them on you have been watching before they were together and you could see they liked each other
David and Victoria make a great couple.
Must be a good marriage if switching bookmarks is considered a “really terrible offense” !! 😂
"David is so lucky to have such intelligent and charming partner. They have such wonderful chemistry.
His wife is lovely, too."
I had no idea they were married
"Terrible title for a piece of pure fun, change it FFS."
"3:19 that exquisite silence after ""but he doesn't hate me, right?"" everyone in the room held their breath, every eye turned to David..."
David’s so lucky to have someone so intelligent and gorgeous and David looks like that sorry Lee you’re fan had to have a go to hehehehe love all you guys
A whole show could probably be made around the pedantic bickering in David and Victoria's marriage.
BBC don't need clickbait title
"There's no reason for it not to be. Likewise, her having 7 or 8 books on the go."
"Wrong. He was saying how he imagines david to be a nice guy, then says ""but"" and shrugs as in ""but I could very well be wrong"" as he also admits lee knows david much better. Stop looking for things that aren't there."
It would be emotional and psychological abuse.
No Victoria is the lucky one
Wooooooooosh
Smooth. Well done.
Lol i think i can hear Webb feeling left out.
I am happy for both Victoria and David. They seem so good together :)
I see what you did there!
K P. He meant Lee
Aha! I see what you did there. Me likey!
I see u following lee's steps here lol
HAHAHAHAHAHA
 @keyqui05  you'll understand sarcasm one day
 @janesmith699  Webb will always come 1st. Bloody love Peep Show
I think David in this scene is a prime example of what she sees in him :)
BOOM
Good one.
I think I'm going to throw up.
​ @janesmith699  he's under the desk stroking his balls
Victoria's equally lucky. I love them.
So true love this show
"A part of me wished David had done a Lee and pressed True first just see the reaction of everyone, especially Victoria and then said Lie."
Victoria's expression of complete betrayal....I also love how horrified Clare looks.
I didn't know WILTY moved to channel 4
"1:57 That, my friends, is the look of love. :)"
"She’s quite hot and she’s married to David Michelle, how’d that happen?"
"Victoria - a 7
David - a 1
Yea it’s not money."
Her face when he says it is priceless
"Here, BBC, have a down-vote from me.
I've already seen the episode and knew it was nothing like that.

Person who manages BBC's youtube channel - you suck."
I actually kind of enjoy how Victoria plays along with the lie to make it seem real.
NEW HEADLINE TODAY. BBC DOES CLICKBAIT AND VIEWERS HATE IT. CLICK HERE TO SEE WHY!
"I can't remember how the American call the celebrity couple ummh... dammit! That woman who played Ma... Angelina Jolie!!! Maleficent! And was it with Brad Pitt?

David and Victoria is the world version for that term. 👌🏻"
"“Incidentally, I’ve been feeling weaker and weaker...” LOL"
Aww! Its so much fun when they have a couple on the show. They both are made for each other... David and Lee
"BBC, it's not a good title. WILTY doesn't need that kind of provocative clickbaiting-titles. Keep it simple, please."
"i never knew they were married. i knew he was married, but i never realized her. i've watched them both on stuff for years, but never knew they were together. but i'm american. so i only see them on a few shows i watch on youtube. i like them both more now."
When he said the lie I literally imagined Victoria downstairs looking up the weather while David is sneaking in like a Comic Book villain laughing maniacally as he moves her bookmark 😂
David’s punching with her.
Lee has always been superb but David has gone from strength to strength and is now right up there with being as funny as Lee
The funniest segment I've seen on this show.  Brilliant
Please change this title
That would be good.
He didn't want to risk his marriage falling apart.
"Yes, Clare was a big part of this being so funny, I loved the 'emotionally invested' bit, only just noticed that that came first from the guy on the right on Lee's team."
She's probably really annoying once you get to know her
Hot??? The epitome of a frumpy fishwife. Awful at presenting and only on TV because of her father... basically a chubby Zoe Ball or a Ferne Cotton who doesn’t know as many musicians
"Read the chapter ""The End of the Beginning"" in his autobiography, ""Back Story"". You can also find that chapter of the audiobook, read by him, on Youtube."
" @uoyebut4757   if you actually research instead ofjust saing things you will find that she started writing for newspapers anonymously when she was 15 and she started appearing on ty because she played poker, it wasn't due to her father"
acasfs001 LOL you can find interviews where Zoe Ball and Ferne Cotton say exactly the same thing “I made it all on my own and had no help honestly”
"I think both David and Victoria have a lot of visible attractive qualities. Sadly you can rarely say the same about youtube commenters.

I'm happy for both of them, they make a charming couple."
"She had an affair with a married man at 25 though & destroyed his marriage (though those things work both ways).
So yeah she's good-looking but she's also kinda trash.

It wouldn't surprise me if she cheated on David either"
" @ChildOfTheWilderness  25 is still quite young when it comes to dealing with love and all its complications, but it is not an attractive fact about her, thats for sure. The married guy carries more responsibility in my opinion though. I think its a huge leap to assume she would cheat on her husband. People mature and she wasn't the cheating one to begin with, let alone that your likeliness to cheat is very dependent on where you are in life and on the person you are with. Love is complicated and old(er) age has allowed me to see more nuances in it. What seemed wrong when I was young has become more grey area now."
"She's a professional poker player and as of 2018, her total live tournament winnings exceed $2,470,000.  I don't think she needs his money mate.  She's also a writer.   Maybe she just likes his personality and humour?  It does happen you know.  Not everyone wants a trophy wife/husband.  Here's the article on her:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Coren_Mitchell"
Humour gets you far
Pambudi Wardhani do you mean otp (one true pairing)?
 @blueymakeupgirl  something along with Ameican sweetheart? Not so sure.
r385671 dictoria lol. 😂 They're both quite dominant so it fits. Vivid is cuter. I can't decide.
"Mia Smith during The Bubble, was one of the best times: ""My David"" and the past where David said he is applying up with his long term comedic partner"
Now you gone and done it.   BBC is now petitioning Youtube to take all of WILTY's clips down.
Agree. It's just comedy not Relate.
"It will never change it's all about ad revenue literally the first sign of it here means it's here and it's never going to go away because it works. Only solution is to not watch clickbait titles and go for aptly named things but it's called click bait for a reason cus we're all dumb joy-starved frenzied consumers that will just click on the most woosh bang title we see in order to satisfy the addiction of opening up YouTube.. it's a perfect addictive trap sink hole of time wastage and getting annoyed that one of the spikes going through you is not how you would like spikes to be made, is really the least of your worries.

I'll say that again, if you're opening up YouTube with the barely preplanned desire to watch something but you don't know exactly what, you're addicted. You will not just close YouTube as it is a heinous waste of time, you will watch at least one thing to get the reward chemical released for the effort and stress of opening the app and wondering what might be there and if it'll be any good and what are the comments like etc and worse is you watch 2, 3 ,4 5 videos before you're satisfied or worst is if you're like me and have become numb and once you open YouTube you can just keep going and going for hours and hours a day... then you're literally in need of a kind of YouTube rehab. Try not opening it up unless you have a specific topic/video in mind that you wanna research. 

People will say I'm bullshitting or taking it too serious but it's real, and it's not spoken about."
" @thelolmaster1997  
You know what, I'm printscreening that and I'll make it my screensaver for my laptop :) Thankyou."
 @thelolmaster1997  I needed to read that. Thanks man.
 @thelolmaster1997  Wow.. sometimes reading the comments pays off massively...
" @thelolmaster1997  
Just as an update, it's still my screensaver, it has helped often :)"
"if i can channel my inner Mitchell here , you're complaining about the truthfulness of the titles used by a show could ""would i lie to you""?"
"BBC News has also gone 100% clickbait tabloid bullshit over the past decade or so, so sadly you're nuts if you're expecting their other media platforms not to follow suit. The BBC used to be a somewhat respectable organisation, but nowadays it's pointless for us to keep holding them to the kind of high standards we've traditionally held them to."
"Chill, BBC plays this game too: they lie to us."
"I'm going to reiterate what @thelolmaster1997  said but shorter: 
The only way to discourage clickbait is not to click on it.

They don't care if you're angry. They don't care if you're upset. They care whether or not you click, and whether or not you watch."
"Everyone saying ""agree"" — I am going to say I disagree. if you know the show, you also know that it is a recurring theme that lee and david, on the show, are antagonists. And Lee tries to make david uncomfortable. The title is appropriate."
 @astropgn  yeah I was gonna say the title isn't that inaccurate and if they were really accurate they would have spoilt the ending
Been a favorite

Icónico.. hermoso video

It is amazing song! The melody and the lyrics and the sounds is all perfect!!! I wish more songs togethers!!! ✨✨👏🏻👏🏻💓🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻😘✨💋💋💋💜💜💜💜
1:10  Love the little Moonwalk Shakira does.  Cool Dancing.  Thanks for the video and music.
Yo también adore la Chaqueta de Taboo y el clip en la solapa está cool y quiero tus gafas jajaja

"And you are THE king! 🙌🏻👏🏻 Thanks for making this for us, we really apreciate it!"
When you have legends you don’t need any of the fluff. Shakira and BEP making art. Taboo’s smile and outfit 10/10
"Gotta publish de coreo version only at some point. It’s going to be next level, just already imagine everyone uploading videos on Tik Tok. Amazing job Will 🤟🏻"
 @kaumranesna-ashari8902  Shaki has always reminded ne of MJ (in terms of originality and uniqueness). Now I know why 😊
"""Simple, minimal,futuristic and iconic""......pretty choice words for your video depicting the destruction of a city while Shakira sings ""looking for a girl like me?"" We're not looking for the whore of Babylon....it's clear if you have the eyes to see and the ears to hear."
"You will exist forever. You and God are both in the universe to stay—either as friends on His terms, or enemies on yours—which it will be is proven in this life. And this life is a vapor. Two seconds, and we will be gone."

"Your entire group of entertainers -- None of them can actually sing.

It's rather awkward how a popular group that does well in the music industry can't sing (yet pretends to be able to).
I mean, you're not a DJ or anything.

You can't even properly write sentences.
--

People usually say ''He's so succesful -- I'm jealous.''
I'm really not.

I'd rather be me and in the middle of the middle class than be rich and an uneducated fake.
I'm true to myself, and it doesn't seem like you or even most people are.

Just throw everything you have at the wall and see what sticks rather than do what you're meant to do in life, huh?
Like start singing when you can't even fucking sing... 

This isn't necessarily a hate comment seeing as that it's simply factual."

The hand movements the spanish beat her dances moves. So iconic this will not get old. Look she's already at 976k likes over 3 millioms views at day 4. Come on with it she will probably get at least 3million likes I'm here before it happens.

Thanks TJ :-)
It can be... But like any city it has it's fair share of issues also :-)
The 380's quite a sight to see. Surprisingly quiet for their size :-)

"I wish she would just let her fangs out. Evil Hag, please sacrifice me to the dark goddesses for your Coven. Bring hot chicken wings please. I'll eat wings and you can feast on the blood of the innocent. 🤣"
God Aubrey I love you. Your sense of humor is my thing.
This was the birth of wood milk. What you talking about.
I'm glad you watched this and can see that Aubrey's character is just that.  Now stop being a fan of a one trick pony that's been milking the same routine for over a decade.
Now she's snorting wood milk.
Absolutely gorgeous young lady.
The saxsophone moment was the best xD
I literally never have any idea if she ever joking or not
She drank her spit
First picture + reaction rolled me
Love Aubrey ❤
"Here me out...Shawbry, the next power couple (I know this is 3 years old)"
How in the world did you not ask her about the best thing she was ever in??? SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED!! I would say you fumbled on the five yard-line.
"If you're a Hollywood writer and you arent trying to write the perfect script for either a movie or tv show starring Audrey Plaza and Jenna Ortega, are you even really a Hollywood writer? Those 2 make such an epic duo lol"
Unattractive face
"What is everyone fascination with this chick, you people are imbeciles"
"She has a point. People like her Parks&Rec character, but there is a danger of typecasting the girl due to the popularity of that role."
Just all attitude probably the worst guest on the show😂
I've seen quite a few of these and this is one of the best ones! 😂😂😂😂
I like my mommy 😂❤
"the trick to eating scorching hot spicy things is to NOT touch them with your lips, else >1000% worse"
shes so cute :3
She’s the best
What’s wrong with that? Heck I would drink her spit
OK? We all drink our own spit every single day.
 @lucyk310  still doesn't explain why a ghost sprayed ectoplasm all inside my pants when she did it
ok Stephanie
You spelt *the best wrong.
she lowkey doesnt care about anything
I love this woman 😂
I’m hard
Love the questions about oversharing when she casually blows her snots into the napkin😂😂
Jesus the single sexiest interview I've ever seen
She is fantastic
Okay but what was she doing in the 711 parking lot🤨🤨
This is the best! I've never seen Aubry react to anything in life. She's been a robotic board (who I adore mind you) and to see her react ro anything is just amazing.
Aubrey is awesomness personified. Would love to hang out with her.
She's so likeable and funny and her eyes are well magical
I totally love her . She's  a nasty girl
She's a hot Mckenzie Phillips
She can eat wings while looking up at me. Can I drink her leftover milk
Did she drink the spit water
Who spits into a clean cup of water with 55 napkins on the table.. lol😂😂
"Can we stop with showing the last wing at the beginning. Its a spoiler for me almost. Let the interview play out, we're already invested. smh."
“I like my mommy” 18:00
She’s so wonky lol
"""you aint gona take me down little chickies"" 😂😂😂"
Aubrey Plaza is the best!
why?
What a sexpot.. one in a billion brown eyed devil.
I'm Here!
Why they don’t eat all the meat? So much waste… I find this very disturbing.
Surprised she didn't pour that glass of milk all over her head!
Jajaja son novatos probando esas salsas. Vengan aquí a México y verán lo que es bueno.
She’s so hot
Aubrey who? ...  FYI Apple juice works far better than any other method in neutralizing spicy foods.
I'll marry her...no joke
"Pay attention girls, this is what men want."
i will let her whip me in my nuts !!!!
Wow impressive move Aubrey hot wing queen 😂😢😊
I would marry this woman so fast...
She's the sexiest women on earth she just radiates hornyness haha
Anything higher than spf30 only blocks more uv rays on a microscopic scale. Spf 30 blocks 97% of UV rays and spf50 blocks 98%
Coke buds😍
I want her so bad.
Eyes chico 👀🤍
Sean you're great also.............. great vid
"Never have watched much of Aubrey but I watched this whole video, loved it!!!!!  I really like her......................"
I feel guilty for thoroughly enjoying this.
I watched a few shows yours was the best 😅
Shes awesome
Watched the entire video. She's very cool
4 minutes into video she seems like a very arrogant and cocky girl. Way too full of herself and stardom. Hop she gets humbled
Aubrey Plaza + Ryan Reynolds + The most TOXIC SCRIPT EVER written = PLZNAO
She's totally fu** a lot of producers in Hollywood
"""teach Tupac to survive his reality""
Tupac's mom.

Well good job"
Aubrey has been the most fun I've see on your show😂
"And yet she is single, western civilisation...."
Best guest ever
Shes the best 😂
I swear I'm in love with her.  She seems so cool
lol aubreys hilarious. great video!
Talking Head[s] Oingo Boingo ee Plazalanche chilichillchinchilla 😶
She's weird
I am becoming a big fan of Aubrey...
I love Aubrey!
The queen of awkward. Thanks for being weird successfully Aubrey.
That was downright disgusting.  What a disgusting...'lady'?
By far one of the best ones I have watched lol
likely by her own choice.
" @mikeh3559  hhh not biological choice,  but you got a point , it's up to her."
what
She looks like Lady GAGA
"“yeah i’ve been going to therapy keeping my eyes on the prize”

“ yeah we were more talking about if you have a movie coming up “"
She is so dry the desert shivers 😂❤
"@22:00 did he say ""I feel whole now"" or ""I feel your hole now""; cause there were references during the recording to ""orrifices""."
This is the funniest episode! The milk coming out of her nose 😩😂
I llllove eating spicy food with hot tea/coffee.
Tums being the sponsor is brilliant. Very on brand lol.
i like my mommy
Idk but she's so beautiful and  the way she acts and is
I'm in love with her.
So freaking likable!
How’s she 38 tf
16:47 and 19:18 my fav parts lol
This girl is creepy

she sees her self as clean. peairing her with jemma is nt gd. y they did.
"wen picture excite u.
shelk torture seof then cry an be ge"
Aubrey is funny as heck
Aubrey rocked it
is someone playing a saxiphone
Soo sniffen milk is the power move huh?
21:56 genuine moment where emotion almost overtook
Try the end hot sauce. I dare you
Hot sauce Aubrey. 🌶️
I love you Aubrey.
Why is she so hot?
"Nevermind the milk, how was that glass of spit water 🤣"
What a great sport.
"""I like my mommy."" Poor thing, you can tell a person is in real pain when they start to miss their mom. 😂"
She ain't my type but yet🤔
Aubrey is so real and authentic she’s weirdly unique and beautiful
Everyone keeps saying the Jeff Goldblum pose is from Jurassic Park and it's actually from The Fly.
I love that girl
Yeah she is just as terrifying in real life.
"I don’t get how he stayed so calm and collected, she is sooo funny… I would have been dying the whole time 😭"
can i buy those hankachiefs
7 mill scoville level
Did y'all really bought that toilet monster for demonstration 😭🙌
Mufunguh
U r great and bueatiful your lipps are so desirable and your eyes deserve too be kissed
"It's so freaking amazing. Audrey Plaza looks so much like my daughter is freaky. Looks like her, talks like her, acts like her. Exorcism
Especially when my daughter was in her early 20s. Also, my daughters husband is so much like Chris Pratt when he was on Parks N Rec. It's just so funny watching that show and seeing them acting like my daughter and son in law."
She said heimlich remover hahaha
She is hot. Awkward interview though
How does it work when she's all sarcastic and deadpan and also adorable
I'd love to merry a woman like Audrey Plaza. Hilarious and gorgeous.
"They would honestly be a good couple, yk but I wanna marry her so"
I find her to be off-putting.
I peed i her mouth atfeter pizza
She looks like she gives unenthusiastic blowies.
I feel like she's a lot like her character in criminal minds.
"""THAT'S THE MOVE!!!""😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Way to go Aubrey plaza.❤❤❤❤
She drank her own spit water...
Idk if it’s just me but their only commercial is there own-
"Milk up the nose,classic 😂"
"Love Aubrey, but humans do some really dumb stuff.  Eating this stuff is one of them."
Aubrey Plaza is the most gorgeous American Girl by far and has been for the last 5 years at least
You can't even spell her name correctly 😂
"yeah, casually a serial killer who's killed 100+ people."
Well... I mean it's HER spit that came out of HER mouth ... so what?
 @brianstraight9308  why are you crying
 @jacobybachman8896  it's you crying over her spitting in her own drink.
Karen alert
"20:43 I love that he doesn't laugh when she says ""..without ruining my reputation."""
she is so not funny
Hottest woman ever
They should be together - perfect fit
Aubrey’s persona says a lot about us.
So she does require food. I didn't know angels required food.
"Sean...I was thinking that if you wanted to (optional, of course) you could do a spin off on hot ones where instead of wings...you do the show with Burritos...and you need to eat the WHOLE burrito...with hot sauce onnit...that would be the spin, see?!  You'd get some pretty interesting reactions if your guests were eating 10 WHOLE BURRITOS with progressively hotter hot sauces on 'em.  Eh, eh....whaddayathink?"
"Wow, I mean WAOW - how good was that!?  You go AUBREY!   GAOOOOOW!!!!  (That saxophone bit was really just too funny!)"
can you send me the cup of water?
Aubrey is the best
I want a clone of Aubrey..
She's like a method comedian that won't get off the stage til she's dead
18:25 welcome
"Aubrey is brilliant, beautiful and charming. Perfect woman."
She’s so gorgeous and her personality is amazing af 😫❤️💯
Did she spit in the water then proceed to drink it…
I would let her use me as a table if she wanted
I wish they'd go back to the single table already.
She's awesome!
now I want ryan reynolds and aubrey plaza to star in a movie just imagine the dynamic
You'd drink her spit water too.
"Best set i have ever ever watched, Love her Hair."
I had tears streaming thru this one 😭 🤣
she is a gem
She's a dream.
"As she rightly stated to sean, you do this to get something from me any reaction so that sean himself can feel something. Awkward, real and true."
Isn't me or Aubrey plaza is too unpredictable. She's direct and real to you. Bitter reality will be thrown at you.
"Sean you're a badass... Aubrey put the milk up her nose, so you followed suit.... badass move."
She needs a real host to interview her.  She literally told this guy she would eat anything he gave her and he had nothing provocative to say!  She’s dropping hints she wants to give the guy good ratings.
Best part was when she looked right at me and said FU 😍 yes please lol
""" I just eat whatever you tell me to "" 


Eat me 😢😅😂😂😂"
She was hot in more ways than ever that day :-)
"The best episode so far, she’s amazing to watch!"
Why is it that sometimes they have one table and other times there are two?
"She's great, I love her"
"""Oh! I have Andy Dwyer's aviators. I don't take care of them at all."""
I love how she’s like “that’s a fun game” she seems like she really likes to play little games
I'd love for her to darken my misery as I laugh with her 😊
we want boygenius on hot ones
😂 can't not love her 😂
She is a perfect actress to play a witch
She’s just fantastic ~ when she’s told this I really hope she’s listening… sweet girl.😊
god she's so bad
I love me some Aubrey Plaza! Thanks for getting her on your podcast!
how can she be burned? she is hotter than any sauce
i swear the wings were hotter in the early days
She’s everything I could ever want in a woman
I didn't know she was Puerto Rican 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Please bring her back for another episode or let her host one. She's great
"Thank you, First We Feast! Keep up the good work. Sean Evans is a beast.
Hot Ones knows how to turn a celebrity into a regular joe within minutes :)"
THE MILK ON THE NOSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
hahahahahahahahahahahaha thats so good!!!!!!!!!!
Painfully disturbing woman
So in love with her!
I knew I wanted to marry her at the toilet goblin recant.
Aubrey is weird but good weird.
Why do they wait until a person touches their eyes to tell them not to?
I love seeing how the wings made her brake her character
"Heeey Aubrey,
I love the toilet monster puppet thing somewhere in this video.
 I need to make a toilet monster. I need to make several
toilet monsters. I wanted to ask you: When you were performing
for your people sitting at tables and eating job which performance
typically got you the biggest tip?"
the grumpy cat part ended me
why is she bad? she did good
 @Ashley-km4qi  bad as in attractive lol
she’s taken
She really crazy no acting here
18:25 💀💀💀
She's the female version of moistcritikal
No followup questions on the undead cat story??
Poor Aubrey 😖 But she is adorable 😜
She was a standup? Wow.
19:05 Duke Silver
Sean rules. Aubrey seems a bit snotty/unfriendly.
I wanna have her baby.
"She's cute but kind of disgusting xD I know that strange things are happening to people while eating those wings of fire, but spitting in the glass of water? Come on :P"
I wish I’d seen Aubrey plaza pour milk into her eyes
She spit into her water glass and then she continued drinking from it!  Nasty! 🤮
"kinda boring, i wanted her to actually answer the questions."
god I love Aubrey Plaza.
Hahahaha she’s so crazy!
Darnk pro_mentsos™methoa_high_dactivia™
I’m a lady ok?
"“Maybe if you have a movie or anything though” 
“Oh oh yeah…” 😂"
Hey weirdness make her even more gorgeous idk why 😂😂😂
“Let people know what you have going on In your life” confused me so much the first time I heard it too 🤣🤣🤣 I was like how r they supposed to answer that??

this is my favorite episode in a while
Wth was she air catching serious question 😳😳👻
Real Fighter!
Oh I forgot how intimate and close the seating arrangement used to be
Such a fun show 😁
I love how weird and authentic she is 😆
"Get a new car, that old rickety thing won’t last 3000 miles, otherwise I would’ve hopped in. 🤷🏼"
I am so late to this show I LOVE IT!!!! my new favorite
Dream women
she so fine bruh .
Mommy
“i thought you were talking about biden” IM CRYING SJJDJD
"I had 500,000 hot sauce once…just as a “taster”, so a small sample that was put on a popsicle stick. I’ll NEVER do that again. I’m Hungarian and thought it would be no sweat. I had so much drool and snot and tears running out of my face I literally couldn’t breathe for a few seconds. I was in a semi-panicked state in fact. Lordy it was memorable. And with regard to Ms. Plaza I would love to, but be terrified to meet her.👍🏻😬 Terrified almost as much as trying that hot sauce again."
She’d tear mans apart in bed believe! Love her to bits.
"Aubrey is so funny, and doesn't appear to have to try.  She can carry such a serious tone in the silliest circumstances... in much the same way Leslie Nielsen did in almost every role he played. 😀  She even gave a shout out to her Puerto Rican heritage.  She has great range, too, with roles like Black Bear and Child's Play to Parks and Rec and any other other comedy.  Her timing is wonderful, and she could easily have been a full-time stand-up comedian if she wanted.  As another comment said, she could totally play a relative of Wednesday in the new series.  🙂"
"That's funny. Most guys, and many girls too, just want to move staight in to Bendover with her."
18:34 yes he’s the best and she’s my fav
ADRENOCHROME JUNKIES-THEY EAT BABIES!!
"""Snorts."""
best one yet
her reactions felt like the phases of an acid trip
"As favorite celebrities goes, Aubrey must be my favorite. She is so incredibly wierd! But only in a good way! 
And she is 🔥, so having her on this show makes sense!"
18:36 her snorting milk is so funny
her little giggle at 18:02 is so charming
"Aubrey is so natural, down to earth, doesn’t think she’s better then the next person, she’s Genuine as it gets, her personality is a true gift, likable to everyone who comes across, you can’t hate her, there’s not a reason too."
i came
What is the thumbnail when you hover over it?!?
now i MUST buy a toilet goblin....
best ever!!
"i am watching this video with so much confusion from her statements i don’t know how to feel, i love it."
We need Ryan Reynolds on this show.
From Delaware 😂
Her pouring milk into her nose is iconic
She seemed to reboot herself before wing 9.
LOVE ME SOME THROWED OFF AUBREY PLAZA ❤😊😂😅😢
Where's the snorting at ? Anyone got a timestamp?
19:17: is golden.   LOL
Aubreys WOW !
Aprill ludgate my all time crush😩😩😩😩😩
"She’s perfect, personality,looks and wits"
Everyone so enthralled by Aubrey that they failed to notice that she drank from the glass of water that she spit in.
Love her ❤
"Vanderwende's ice cream, all the way. Butter pecan is yum."
She so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
She's so good he doesn't know whether or not to laugh or get help!
GOD she is so GORGEOUS! 😍😍😍
"Aubrey is amazingly unique, love her!"
I sweat just watching this show 🤤
to be honest any men out there would like to flood Audrey's inbox
Wifeyyyy 😩
one of the best red carpets - great job Sean as always
"You never had Scrapple, dude???  You're missing out.  I love her response.  ""meat"""
How many habaneros were harmed in all this? 🇲🇽 Hot peppers....First cultivated in Mexico! 🇲🇽
I’ve never seen someone seem so happy yet so angry all at the same time
Leave her alone
c'mon man. watch the whole thing - you're missing out
Definitely worth watching it all.
She really sells what she's saying with her unblinking eyes.
"She's right; she's not likeable. Sorry Sean, but I can't watch any more of this episode.  Not your fault."
"Aubrey is simply THE BEST! 
She  is one of the funniest people and very talented 
love her roles in  White Lotus  Emily the criminal parks and rec and legion  
very excited to see her in the MCU (Agatha Coven of Choas )"
She's a zany cool chick.
❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Love her so much
"""Heimlich remover"" is what you need, after that halfway point.
Lol..... you're my hero, lady."
She is definitely amazing.
2:41: Aubrey Plaza disses the Cha Cha Slide...
"6:30 I drink black coffee and eat spicy foods. 
It is one of the worse combinations for your mouth."
"""You ain't gonna take me down little chickies, I an eat all of you."" 12:14"
Love her 👌
"I haven't seen a whole bunch of these episodes. but she just ate a wing with 2,000,000+ scoville on it like a Boss."
I'd like to take a bite of her hot wing.
She is so hot
Anterior Cruciate Ligament.  She’s awful.
:I
"Aubrey: ""IM DYING!""
Sean: ""So what do you think about delaware."""
i love how she's like casually crying while having a straight face
PLAZA I freaking love you! 🏜
Best contestant ever
9:16 is gold
"Wait, did she said her cat came back from the death? Why there wasn´t more questions asked??? Zombie Cat?"
Ok we all have to admit it. Aubrey turns us on. Amazing. God I would jump this woman so fast.
She is so boring. If she was my my girlfriend I'd just leave.
