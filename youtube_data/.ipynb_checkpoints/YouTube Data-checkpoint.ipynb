And btw I'm a young Belgian author myself, 21 years old, and it's awesome to be able to create my own stories. I've learned to write tho by reading tons of books. So reading is a part of my life. My first book is now only available in Dutch (called 'Het meisje dat haar vijand omarmt' or 'The girl who hugs her enemy' in English) and its sold already 500 times. Hopefully one day the whole story might be translated to English. I'm now writing at my second story, which will be a serial. 😊\r\n",
