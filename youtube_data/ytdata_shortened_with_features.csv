The capsaicin is stored in the placenta and membranes on ridge or spine that runs the length of the pepper. The seeds come in contact with the capsaicin  simply because of proximity to the source but that's all the heat they contribute. This why the seed heavy selection was not as hot as the one with more pepper flesh, even though it was guessed that it would be. It's a common myth that exists because seeds are attached to the placenta and that is where the heat resides partially. Just food for thought. Enjoyable video either way.",2,1,651,118,1,0,1.0

318,"Flakey on the pepper flakes, as it isn't the seeds that hold the heat, but the embryonic membrane that hold the seeds to the pepper. It would be easier and cheaper to cut the peppers in half and scrape the seeds with a knife, but you are also removing the embryonic membrane as well; and the seeds are put back in either fostering the  illusion they have heat, or they believe that themselves.

With a higher end hot pepper, you dry them first, cut the end and shake out most of the seeds leaving the embryonic membrane intact. 

With the black pepper, it looks like a high quality to low quality commercial production. I paid quite a bit more for my black pepper collection, but figuring heavily is the uniqueness of the pepper corn as well how it was processed, and many estates do things in a unique manner. Even regarding white people, so soak the shell off in water, others let it fully ripen and then remove the shell. Yet that give you a variety where you can create your own unique flavors. I always give out my recipes out, but they can't figure out that the spices I use are very high quality and unique.

Want to learn cooking, no man hasn't lived until he finds himself in a kitchen with ten Indian women that absolute don't want you thare. But they insisted that I use Indian spices to cook with Indian food, and I figured out why. Because they are usually older and less in quality, they use increased quantities. They also lightly toast their spices to bring out the oils. Still, I messed with them because I used higher quality spices, and turmeric is definitely one of them and they could never figure out, why I had a much more dynamic flavor profile.",7,4,1669,307,5,2,12.0

But if you read those books of his just about everyone on the show is just regurgitating what he wrote. Why can't I remember his name. Darn me!!!!

Anyways they were all debunked. I think of this Ancient Astronaut crap and I go back to that movie Zeitgeist. That's all I can think of. As an older 20 year old when Zeitgeist first came out I was entranced and mesmerized by Peter Joseph's ""discoveries"" about all the religions of the world sharing the same attributes as Christianity. I swallowed that garbage word for word. It turned out years later I researched the religious material Peter Joseph expounded, and.... well..... he made it up. Yeah.... dude made it all up. There was a woman he was working with back then who died of cancer a little later on where he got most of his information from named S. Achyrae (Pen name) and books she wrote. The problem is that S. Achyrae basically just made up her own story on world religions as a whole and just interweaved whatever her imagination could spin. Quite depressing that I was duped like that. Just imagine what's happening in America today, and the saddest part is I still hear people puking up that Zeitgeist bullcrap on religion. 

Yeah people.... it's called research. It's called citing information. But educational information nowadays is more on whatever one can imagine and sounds good enough to dupe a populace. If I was that arrogant back then just imagine how many others are now, but as we can see that ""imagination education"" as I call it has taken America by storm.

Why have you left the high, holy, and everlasting heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men, and taken wives unto yourselves, and acted as the children of earth, and begotten giants as sons? 4. While you were spiritual, holy, having eternal life, you defiled yourselves with women, and with the blood of flesh have begotten children, and have lusted after the blood of men, and have produced flesh and blood as they produce who die and are destroyed. 5. Therefore I have given them wives that they might impregnate them and children be born by them, as it is done on earth.  6. You were formerly spiritual, living an eternal life without death to all the generations of the world. 7. Therefore I have not made for you any wives, for spiritual beings have their home in heaven. 8. And now the giants, who have been begotten from body and flesh, will be called evil spirits on earth, and their dwelling-places will be upon the earth.  9. Evil spirits proceed from their bodies; because they are created from above, their beginning and first basis being from the holy watchers, they will be evil spirits upon the earth and will be called evil spirits.  10. But the spirits of heaven have their dwelling-places in heaven, and the spirits of the earth, who were born on the earth, have their dwelling-places on earth.  1. And the spirits of the giants, who cast themselves upon the clouds, will be destroyed and fall, and will battle and cause destruction on the earth, and do evil; they will take no kind of food, nor will they become thirsty, and they will be invisible.  12. And these spirits will not (?) rise up against the children of men and against the women because they have proceeded from them. In the days of murder and destruction.   CHAPTER 16  1. Аnd of the death of the giants, when the spirits have proceeded from the bodies, their flesh will decay without judgment; thus they will be destroyed till that day when the great judgment over all the great world will be completed over the watchers and the impious.  2. And now to the watchers who have sent you that you should petition for them who were formerly in heaven say:  3. ‘You have been in heaven, and though the secrets were not yet revealed to you, still you knew illegitimate mysteries, and these you have, in the hardness of your hearts, related to the women, and through these mysteries, women, and men increase wickedness over the earth.’  4.

For example, look up the ancient Mayan airplane model found by archaeologists which present-day aeronautical engineers used to build the same exact plane that actually flies. Some Christians believe that the ancient people who lived before the great worldwide flood mentioned in the Bible were technologically more advanced and that this explains the evidence of that that we have been seeing. So you have Christians  who believe these advanced people to have been wiped out by the flood and nonChristians who believe that they were aliens or received their advanced technology from aliens.
We have lots of evidence that our government and maybe even the Catholic hierarchy in general will push this idea of aliens or an alien god in order to unite the world under one religious and governing system in the future. Watch for the Biblical prophecy that the world is going to eventually become one world government! I think most people are aware of this worldwide movement by now. If not, it will become apparent at some point.

468,"The story about the race in the Antarctica.
The story behind them. The atlanteans were martens from Mars. around 50,000 so years ago.
I asked my contactee about the race in Antarctica, I asked if they were from Mars. She is from the Dakota tribe, descendant from those who migrated here long ago as a request to help Enki's descendants, or created new life that had been abandoned and left to their own demise. As a contactee, this is only ever done face to face with her own star relations and other star visitors, she does not channel. The one thing she did tell me, is what annoys the star visitors the most, is the wrongly deciphered info found, misinterpretation of information passed on, or lack of it. So you end up with multiple variations of different recorded events, some that never took place here. I believe what angered her the most in recent times, is finding out the Corey Goode will have you believe that our sun blew up Tiamat. This is not true, we are living on what is left of Tiamat that had been Terra-formed after a great cosmic war. It was Maldek that was destroyed.

Answer: No, not from Mars, they came from the other side of the Milky-way, known as SHINTO. It means, Tall Minds. They were just a group of families consisting of, scientists and botanists when they crash landed here. The land mass they exist within now, was in a different place at the time of impact. Their craft after being hit by lightening, was rendered unbalanced causing them to loose control of their craft which ended in a very bad landing. The craft sustained to much damage leaving them stranded here.  This race, had no clue as to what was here when they crashed. According to their records, they came across a beautiful land & water world during their travels wanting to take a closer look. Their own home was also a land & water world. Until people here are taught & shown what they are living upon, they will never figure out the meaning of real life. However, those who crash landed here, did understand quite well just what a cosmic world really is.

The crash took place long after the flood. By the time they were discovered here by other star visitors some time after Enki's rein, the children had grown & settled in with their elders long passed on. It is the elders that have been discovered in stasis burial chambers beneath the ice cap. It was the children who grew up remaining, not wanting to leave as they no longer knew any other home but here. It is quite true they did make their way to the Pyramids where they then began to rein over Enki's creations. They were good to them, eventually they died off. However, they did mix with Enki's creations of new life that survived the flood. Unfortunately ,most of the babies died as there was a significant height & anatomy difference between themselves & the people already born here. Very few new born's survived. The mixed breeds that did survive, left with other star visitors in the later years of their lives to be returned to the original home world of their decadents.

Below is an answer from my contactee after I suggested this is why Lemuria sank over time along with Atlantis, and why we are finding artifacts and ruins both on land and under the sea in modern day times.

(The real Christ was a elongated skull child, one of the grown elongated children's child. Romans found the story on a pyramid wall long after Egypt had been all but abandoned at the time. They stole it for themselves changing names, dates, locations, then used it against their own people together with the Roman Catholic Priests,  in a very threatening way as a means of political religious control. Roman soldiers & priests told a lot of lies back then, & Catholic priests still lie about the truth today. Back then, many civilizations lived on floating cities. They fought among themselves before & after Enki & Enlil time here. You would not expect anything different as they were descendants from Anunnaki war lord minds. It was in their genetic makeup to be that way & still is today.


With the exception of the native land people, others here have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to past history, along with no clue what soever as to what it is they are even living on the exterior of, nor do they know what S/HE is out there in the Cosmos that created the beginning of the Cosmic Realm. People here don't understand there is a living, growing fetus inside beneath their feet. Her head is beneath what they are calling, the North Pole, her feet beneath, the South Pole. With 1 arm stretched out to the East, the other to the West.

To live in harmony with Mother Earth, you need to understand a baby's movement inside a mother's womb. When she moves around inside the membrane within her shell, the scattered exterior debris moves with her as her outer protective shell is flexible. A human baby does a complete turn around twice during incubation. Tiamat/Gaia turns many more times than twice during her own incubation at a slower rate.  You don't want to be here if that happens, as the upheaval of surface debris is tossed all over the place. Ice caps keep her body temperature stable, it is the same for all the Cosmic Eggs of those who have not yet hatched. Where ever her head and feet are, you have your ice caps. Scientists have only just come to this realization in the last few years.

In the beginning of a new creation of  life, even though the intention was first for a new slave labor in mind, they were taught the truth about this world, the life within & how to always respect, love & care for this life. Those who migrated here, always knew the truth. That truth has remained within the hearts of the native people for many thousands of years, long before man created a false concept he calls, time. For others, the truth was lost along the way.

Where in any school have the people ever been taught the truth about their own existence, or about the inner world they live upon, NOWHERE! Most have no idea they are living on top of debris scattered around the exterior of an egg with inner earth people living deep inside the debris from an exploded world/egg caused through war. They know little to nothing of the life that existed on the exterior before it was knocked out of it's original harmonious celestial orbit.

Question: When Gaia (Tiamat) starts moving, are the land masses rising and lowering. 

Answer: Exactly.

- Dr. Jacques Vallee, Confrontations, p. 13

""The symbolic display seen by the abductees is identical to the type of initiation ritual or astral voyage that is imbedded in the [occult] traditions of every culture...the structure of abduction stories is identical to that of occult initiation rituals...the UFO beings of today belong to the same class of manifestation as the [occult] entities that were described in centuries past.""

Asides from its, admittedly harsh production, the movie has an actually interesting story. The commentary it gives is great but the hypocrisy with its creation is difficult.
We do need extreme cinema to push boundaries (I'm sure y'all can think of a few) but we need to always keep movies like Cannibal Holocaust in mind for 'how not to make such art'.

From cautionary tales told to kids, to stories that deal with the horrors of the human existence and beyond, horror deals with terrible things. Canibal Homocaust seems to me like a genuine piece of clever and profound art, that has been stuffed so full of needless cruelty and shock value that it has ruined the movie like any meal composed 50% of ghost chilli peppers is ruined. Some people want the kick from horrors that burn themselves into your mind, but that's not art any more than a ghost chilli pepper is a meal; they can go togeather and one can even be crucial for the other.

I wish this story had been told resppnsably, I might have revered it, but instead I literally can't watch it and retain my mental health  so I'll n3ver get to see it beyond reading what it contains, and I gotta say I know I'm missing out.

 All the shock and gore is there in the way though, like some challenge to see how able you are to stomach suffering and abuses, which also attracts some of the worst ""fans"", who seem to think it's funny that they tear apart animals.

And yes, I often start with a colored underpaining, it's often yellow ochre or burnt sienna, but sometimes I go with other colors (like this bright pink). There are a few reasons: 

- having something in front of you rather than just a blank page makes it less daunting to start painting

- it forces you to use more opaque paint in order to cover the underpainting

- it makes it easier to gauge your values and colors than white does (white next to any color will make that color appear darker and more desaturated, this makes the colors look more like what they actually look like)

- and finally, it shows through in those parts of the painting where the paint isn't evenly applied, which just adds pops of color variation and makes the painting more pleasing than having dots of white showing up here and there

- ok one more, if you're painting outdoors it makes it so the bright outdoor light doesn't blind you when you're looking at the empty surface you're painting on

Hope that helps!",7,3,1079,198,0,0,16.0
1650,"Thanks! There's really no right or wrong, especially with gouache since you can easily paint on top of dry paint. I did it last mostly because I like leaving the small details for last AND because I tend to jump around the frame so I can work on areas where the paint isn't wet yet. But yeah either way works, the only thing I'd avoid is painting something before painting something behind it. Example, if those pine trees covered the mountain, it would be easier to completely paint the mountain first, then add the trees, that way you don't have to paint the mountain while trying to avoid the trees you've already painted in front of it. Again, it can be done, it's just easier to do it that way.",6,0,699,130,0,0,2.0

1684,"Thank you, I'm glad you think so! I know the feeling, I went through that too and it's actually the reason why it took me a good 4-5 attempts at getting into drawing/painting before I actually stuck with it, each of the attempts that came before failed in a matter of weeks. I could write pages about ways to overcome that feeling, but it's actually part of a video I've been working on (I can't tell you how often I get a similar question) so keep an eye out and I think I might have a few answers for you soon :)

That said, the first thing that came to mind is that maybe you feel like your skills aren't on par with the kind of art you want to create, so drawing becomes a chore because you feel like everything you do will end up a failure anyway. If that sounds familiar, check out this comment I left on an art related subreddit a little while ago, I think part of it may apply to your situation: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/fgh7kj/_/fk59ndu

one, it forces me use thicker paint in order to cover it up (I still tend to use my gouache too thin, so that helps me avoid that)


two, it gets rid of the white of the paper, which helps with gauging values/colors and makes starting the painting feel less intimidating than if I were looking at a blank canvas.


and three, probably the main reason, it peeks through those little areas where the paint isn't applied evenly and adds little bits of color variation that make the whole painting feel more vibrant",4,2,639,116,0,0,7.0

It also glosses over Metric's inconsistent appearance in construction and plumbing and the like, where it occasionally makes an appearance. It also would have been appropriate to refer to the strong age correlations.

Similarly, with fluid units, and miles more generally. I would argue that mile now means ""some large distance"" in the dialects spoken by younger Canadians. I also know a lot of people that use pounds and feet/inches exclusively for body measurements, and estimate weights & distances in other contexts in metric. It might also have been interesting to talk about the trope of Canadians using Fahrenheit for pool temperatures, which I have never seen, and I suspect is an Ontario or western Canada thing?

Weights in recipes and food are almost universally metric nowadays, though some shops do quote weights in pounds as well. Farenheit is rarely seen. Something that is changing among younger Brits, however, is the use of kilograms to measure body weight. I, even as a relatively ancient 35 year old, after living in Malaysia for a while, have switched to using kilos to measure myself. It just feels much more intuitive than using stones and/or pounds.

I was also raised in a military family and was into nautical miles and even the 24 hour clock. I went on working in the tech world and land surveying and as the years went by I witnessed metric construction material such as plywood coming in at 1.2 by 2.4 meters (3 ft 11 in × 7 ft 10 in) and we all saw that disappear faster than it arrived. 
I still work with mm and cm and obviously I easily work with inches. I tend to be always converting to metric in many instances.
The problem is the idea of the need to convert from an old system to metric. That's where you lose peoples interest. Metric calculations can be done by a five year old, inches, yds. and miles on the other hand requires rulers and calculators. Converting is a hassle and the average joe would rather avoid it. OK, maybe that's just me but it's been barely two generations since and the average person still hangs on (and with good reason) to mother's recipes and grand mother's old recipes.

Metric Time, most notably.

Division by 12 will always be the standard for music.  Because it is harmonious.  And calendars will continue to have 12 months.  The Moon naturally divides the year this way.

When metric was invented, the French understood the harmonious advantages of Base 12, and considered switching the entire number system over to that before revamping the measuring system.  But that proposal failed.

And this is why metric will always fail.  Because it lacks natural harmony.  It lacks this fundamental property of divisibility that Base 12 has.  Metric always FAILS when you attempt to do something as simple as divide by 3, or divide by 4.

Because most people don't bother and just get annoyed at the Yanks for having a system that literally no one else uses, apart from some Islands in the Pacific and the Japanese for a while because they were nuked into using US ""Imperial"", which is an oxymoron.

British imperial was based on the inherited Roman system of weights, like with the old money being based on what copper was worth relative to Silver and then Gold for coin ratios, not a decimal system like the Americans had. That's why livestock were measured in hands or the inch was based on the thumb, because these were ancient measurements like the Egyptians used. This is basic stuff.

You also missed out on long and short tons, or the fact that they do Knots wrong as well.

I understand that you're going to try to do some sort of dumbed-down, oversimplified ""both sides"" about imperial, but it doesn't work, because like with the English, one is Imperial and the other isn't. Theirs isn't, it's a bad copy, worse than even the Chinese would do.

For most of Canada's history, as well as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India of course, they all used normal imperial and spoke normal English, just like in England, it was and is only the US that doesn't.

Metric and the US love/hate of it is very interesting. But the story could have been so different.
July 4th 1773 is of course a pivotal date. Casting out the British Empire, it would be a couple of decades before everything would be in place enough to call themselves truely independent.

There were three major things keeping the US connected to the British Empire.

1. Language: There were many languages present, with the most common at the time being German. However after much persistence and having political friends, Noah Webster had intentions to not only drive English as the primary language, but to forge new variations compared with the empire that would sell them on it as being apart from the British.

2. Currency: Pounds, Shillings, Pence. How annoying confusing and British. One pound was equal to 20 shillings, one shilling was equal to 12 pence.
In 1784 Thomas Jefferson presented his ""Notes on Coinage"" to Congress. Decimalisation made sense and was adopted.

For clarify - $1 = 100 cents. Very straightforward.

3. Measurement: Unfortunately at the time there wasn't a sensible replacement to imperial.

Thankfully in this period, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were ambassadors to France. In around 1789, they were speaking to the French about this and really impressed on them the benefits of decimalisation. They too were looking for a new measurement system to consolidate the many systems in France alone, which really impacted trade.
Prieur du Vernois presented a suggestion to the National Academy of France for a single uniform set of weights and measures (almost identical to what he may have heard from Jefferson).
Bottom line, the essential ingredient was making it base 10 and using prefixes like mili.

In this regard, early US settlement likely had a major impact on making the metric system as successful as it is today (even if purely by speculation). But sadly Congress would happily adopt decimalisation of currency, but not measurement.

---

With regards to metric behind the scenes, you're right in the the official date of the international foot and pound was in 1959.
But there was so much inconsistency between imperial standards that it was actually in 1930 (Britain) and 1933 (US), that the first sign of the new industrial inch (conversion from metric standards rather than imperial ones), was seen.


--- 

Compared to the US, Australia dragged its feet much more. Although the US was quick to embrace metric beneath the surface, Australia WAS NOT.

But our move to metric was far more swift and prescribed when it occurred.
People still talk about imperial when mentioning height, but everything else is metric.

One really successful metric adoption was the building industry.

And the key here was - metres and millimetres only! No centimetres.
All measurements on a building site are in mm to ensure that there are no decimal places.

And in the early days, Australia's largest home builder (AV Jennings), built two identical homes as a test.
One had plans in metric, and one in imperial.

Benefits started to show immediately on the metric site. Fraction additions were out the window. No more fractional rulers. Not fractions at all. Measurements were considered more accurate by feel in metric; a comment many builders in the US make when they try metric.

In the end.

1. The imperial site had several truck worths of waste - the metric site had a single wheelbarrow
2. The imperial site cost 10% more to build

from scratch with Metric.

It is the ' Conversion' process that creates confusion.
Using Metric and having all weights and measures shown ONLY
in metric and people will soon become used to it.

To prove how stupid the US Politicians are - I will use examples of
""ELEVATION  and DEPTH of water.

(2000 ft) they converted to 609.6m
It would be certain that the elevation is NOT exactly 2000 feet - and
has been rounded off to the NEAREST FOOT - yet these failed brain damaged
politicians fail to round off the metric measurement to 610 metres.

The same applies to the ""WATER-> depth of (50 ft)"" which in  reality maybe
50 feet and 5 inches - thus rounded off at the NEAREST Foot to 50 feet.
Had those politicians been as 'intelligent' as they imagine them-selves
to be they would round off the depth to 15 Metres -  in such cases an
accurate scientific measure is not required unless one is working in
Engineering - which requires PRECISE measurements.

With the volume and weight of food - ONLY Metric measurements are to be labelled.
People are intuitive by nature and can see what the volume is and what
weight something is - and become accustomed to it very quickly.
Converting from one to the other causes a mental problem.
So STOP converting the measurements and torturing yourselves.

The only thing truly condistent is the use of celsius for temperature  I've spoken to both american and euopean friends about the topic and they do say that it is a confusing, strange situation but it seems only a small minority of wierd brits like myslef actually care, everone else just is used to it and uses wgatever system",1,3,1316,250,0,0,0.0

The problem with that one was that the difference between two degrees of celsius is much bigger than the difference between two degrees of fahrenheit. But I adjusted to that pretty quickly too.

They are so lovable! Great work! Thumbs up! We also love nature, animals and creativity, including photographing, composing music and video editing. As an introduction to our works we recommend you two special videos, one is my lyric/epic composition which has been inspired by a wildlife conservation ( eagles ) project titled Freedom, with Alexandra's video edition, where the camera's point of view is from an eagle's back. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWv-RRqB1d8 The other one is a recently made SpaceX/ Elon Musk respect video, with much love and devotion, with specially composed music inspired by SpaceX's achievements! We recommend you our spectacular movie-like video, we hope it will be an experience! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-CYX4uN7ok With friendly regards: Alex and Alexandra",13,0,986,147,0,0,44.0

4274," @1murdaloca   @1murdaloca   @1murdaloca  I bet they do, and it's not from yt comments or whatever. So you have research her life and her condition from her medical reports and experience from people around her? Your ""professional"" research is probably internet searches about tourettes syndrome overall, but not hers in person. So you have some sort of education on the topic and not just some thing you ""feel"", you said your research was based on professional research and education. You don't have a profession just because you have a  certain condition, just so you know. 
And as I said, you can force it just you did: doctors and your family said you didn't have a condition but you somehow got it on paper, probably by changing doctors and demanding them to write down a condition based on your feelings. 
The people I have discussed with DID actually know her from school and some of them lived in the same neighborhood as her.
I do know people lie, but just because the President says the gov have no interest in a proxy war doesn't mean they don't. The most manipulative people are the most convincing, just like Anita.  I'm not here to argue with someone who ""feels"" something about something. Feelings isn't facts and will never be.

4683,"Britny Fox – Girl School

Come on girls!


A school bell rings off the day,
Brings in a stray a few girls at play.
Cut school pink slips are fine
For a good time there's boys on their mind.

A bad girl smoking in school,
Breaking the rules acting real cool.
Talkin' 'bout all the rock boys,
Back seat joys with some boy's toy.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

Saddle shoes uniforms blue,
Love all the girls in the girlschool.
Traffic jam in the hallway
Ooh I'm gonna stay this makes my day.

Well here they come girls from the school,
Breakin the rules hot on the loose.
My girl left right from school,
Came over to my house, ooh...

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

You're stayin' after school

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
Girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

Loose Hips
Slips of mine,
For a good time,
Boys on their mind

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.

At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules.
At the girlschool, cause my baby broke all the rules

5178,"I like the video but a few things: perhaps people call it an agenda and not natural when you have pride plastered everywhere in your description and even in your video. You said so yourself that it wasn't pride month anymore, but you chose this topic explicitly with this pride in mind. Which, I'm not going to say don't be proud (though I find taking pride in things we have no control over such as our sexuality or race/ethnicity to be silly), but the implications here are not subtle at all. You should be able to talk about something like this without having to present it through a political lens, and unfortunately that's typically how things of this nature get lumped in with. 

I mean, you can't start the video with an almost satirical greeting to the ever expanding acronym of LGBT, un-ironically use the term ""assigned"" when dealing with objective biological sex (which you make very clear is different from gender, so while you can't check chromosomes, it's still not an assignment, it's an observable fact whether you are male or female regardless of your gender later in life) and have as I said, not so subtle shout-out to pride while thinking this isn't political; your express intention seemed political rather than educational, which I take issue with. If you have something scientific to propose, there is zero reason it should be viewed through a political lens no matter how inherently political the topic or your own views. Science doesn't give a fuck, or at least it shouldn't.

That said, I also find it misleading to suggest that non-human animals have gender expression in the same way we do, when again, you make distinct purpose in defining that gender is a social creation. I really don't think lions see it the same way that we do, so why even call it such? Especially when they have no gender identity to therefore express. There also seems to be inherent evolutionary benefits to nearly all of these examples, where humans can simply not say the same thing. Transwomen don't take on that form for any evolutionary benefit the same way a hyena with a pseudo penis would, or the species of bird you mentioned; they do it for personal benefit. They feel misaligned with their biological sex and take measures to facilitate feeling more in line with their identified gender. Gender dysphoria is real and a tragic condition I'd not wish on my worst enemy, and helping these people feel better in their bodies and living the way they want is important, but that doesn't make it an evolutionary thing, or even a natural one. I think terms like ""natural"" and ""unnatural"", or even mental illness have been words tainted by the misuse of prior eras. 

If you think back to a time our societies were governed by theocrats, they would label things natural or unnatural, and see those with questionable social behaviors as ill based entirely on their very limited perspective. They misused the terms to be derogatory and dehumanize people, but that's really not their function. People with mental illness are no less people, and deserve no less respect. Trying to evade calling something an illness or a condition only hurts the person suffering because you give them the idea that what they are experiencing is completely normal or natural and unfortunately, nearly half of trans people killing themselves is anything but normal or natural. It's awful that this statistic is even that high. Calling things like this unnatural or an abnormality isn't or shouldn't be a dig at that person; it isn't something that defines them (or again, shouldn't be), it is just a singular aspect of their being that happens to be different. That's okay. Being trans is okay. Yet, we get into some murky territory when we aim to be so inclusive that we cease even defining them as trans. The phrase ""trans women are women"" comes to mind and is problematic for several reasons. If they were indeed women, we'd just call them women. They are trans women because they are transitioning from one gender to the other. They transition into becoming women; you aren't virtuous because you rob them of their agency to make change by just saying they are women. They are not women. That's fine though, they don't have to be. 

We set ourselves up in these socially constructed bubbles that are immovable. Nobody is willing to think or learn; thoughts and opinions are only accepted if they fit the specific narrative. Do you know what that sounds like? Merely the inverse of the example I mentioned before, about our societies being ruled by people with narrow-minded, conservative thinking. The difference now, is instead of narrow minded conservative beliefs based in theocracy, we have narrow minded progressive beliefs based in sociological principals or perhaps the lack-thereof. It isn't a better outcome, it's just the same with another coat of paint. People should be accepted for who they are, full stop. It's just we've found ourselves overcompensating, and over-correcting by fighting battles that don't need to be fought or have already been won. What is gained by trying to arbitrarily justify trans people in human culture by finding it in other animals when it's hardly even needed? You don't need to justify their existence in this natural sort of way, and if it is a mental disorder, then it's not necessarily one that needs to be cured, but it does need to be treated. Treat these people by helping them live the lives that fit their minds and perceptions of self. A cure isn't something that eliminates a problem, it solves a problem. Trans people living the way they want is a problem solved; cured. We just need to do it the right way, and bring down that staggering statistic of suicide. I just don't think we help anyone by lying to ourselves about the causes and effects of these kind of social issues.",25,28,5820,1001,2,6,-8.0

5241,"​ @TraceDominguez  In humans at least, there are a variety of intersex conditions; None of them produce BOTH sexual organs. The most they do is ambiguate them.
Intersex conditions are sometimes noticeable in genitalia, which makes doctors do horrible child genitalia mutilation (unnecessary genitalia invasive surgery which is entirely arbitrary and aesthetic and can often times lead to complications, plus this is especially true because intersex people have a much higher chance of experiencing gender dysphoria because of the arbitrary and often incorrect gender assignment at birth.) These ""corrective"" surgeries are one of the things the intersex community fights against. Since they are invasive and are a disgusting attempt to make people fit the sex binary who simply do not, and are in any case genital mutilation.


However, this doesn't mean intersex people all have this; Some intersex conditions result in gynecomastia in overall more male-leaning bodies, sometimes this results in other things, like excess body hair on female-leaning bodies. Some are actually unnoticeable; For example, there are many genetic disorders which cause the SRY gene from the Y chromosome to break off and create X chromosomes that have that same gene - In this case, since the SRY gene is responsible for creating TDF (testis determining factor) it will cause masculinization of a genetically female embryo and create what is essentially a completely male embryo besides its' genes. There are many such disorders for both males and females; You might even be intersex and not know it. It is estimated that 1 in 60 people have some intersex condition as far as I'm aware.

A lioness with a mane is more of an intersex than a transgender. She is closer to the South African runner than to Catlyn Jenner. Which makes it a bad example.
As for clown fish, it's a quirk of their biology, not their choice. Listen to your own words, WHEN THE LEADING FEMALE DIES, which means that there is a direct cause to the transition that comes from their BIOLOGY.
As for hyenas, you have got to be kidding me. EVERY hyena female has a pseudo penis, which makes it a shitty fucking example for transgenderism in the animal kingdom! They developed it in order to dominate the males because they have a female dominated society, not because they chose to develop it or grow it, or change themselves.

If you want to be overly pedantic, you could say that what most people think of as one phenomenon is actually a whole set: sex, gender, sexuality, sensuality, romanticism and aesthetics. And each one can be completely independent of one another and be signaling to different people or towards no one at all. An example could be a female (sex) whose social role is that of a man (gender) who has never been in love and doubts he will be (aromantic) but likes having sex with men (homosexual since sexuality is defined from gender) but likes being cuddled and kissed by women (heterosensual) and finds everyone good looking, including people with ambiguous looks (panaesthetic).

One can have sex drive without it being conditioned by the presence or thought about anyone and  that would be called libidic asexuality or one can have no coctel at all and that would be alibidic asexuality.

But let me expose it to you, he's a grown man, with enough force to kill someone if he hit a bad spot, thus why it is 100% illegal and unreasonable whatever the situation, and thus why we instantly see a threat to man rasing hand on a women, the fact you're asking to be reminded those basic matter and laugh to those who doesn't succesfully remind them to you, simply show you're enjoying more to see people suffer if you think the cause is right than to help them getting right. But here's the thing, us, normal people, don't want to see you getting beaten off to learn it or respect, we're here telling you about it, so stop acting like an entitled boomer. You're the exact kind of person to wish to all those in prison to get violated then call it ""justice"" again, yet not acknowledging it doesn't happen because it would be made by other prisonners, and you know what? In reality, the whole prison system isn't made of rapers, and doesn't transform them into one to contaminate each newcomer, we're talking about actual PEOPLE with BRAINS, not zombies needing punishment.

It's a renovated station - by far not the newest (work was reportedly done beetween 2004 and 2006) but impressive when you come upon it. The station is unique in the following way, at least among Bronx stations: You pay your fare on entry at ground level. There are then escalators and elevators; beware the escalators because they don't go all the way to track level; you are confronted with a flight of stairs...but the elevators go all the way up to the track level. 
The station decades ago was bi-level, serving the long-defunct 8 train, itself the last extension of the Third Avenue Elevated and that closed in 1973. In those days, of course, there was no thought of elevators or escalators at this station! 
The only down side of this station is if one or another elevator is down; you're going to do some stair walking. Check the MTA website to avoid surprises.",2,1,1059,181,0,0,1.0

7640,"Caleb was a master class in un-implicating himself from the potential crime that Cameron was about to commit.
- He caught on early once his friend's tone got aggressive.
- Tried to diffuse the situation by minimizing the seriousness of his neighbor's offense.
- Expressed that he thought the conversation was all supposed to be joking.
- Acted like the line was breaking up so he can deny hearing anything that Cameron says.
- Ignored his friend's requests for disclosing which house was the offending neighbor's.
- Repeatedly asked Cameron if he followed him home. This solidifies that Cameron was acting entirely alone and Caleb didn't indirectly abet Cameron's crime.",2,5,670,110,9,0,-11.0

Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”’
Jesus loves you so much that He was willing to give His life on the cross for you! God wants a relationship with you! So put your faith in Jesus Christ today, and you will  be saved, and you will go to heaven when you die! Repent of your sins, ask God for forgiveness, and may the Lord richly bless you!

In fact, they actually believe black people were hated. Of course the politicians and the authority hate black people. But the rest of the population accepted them and white kids born in the mid 70s and 80s actually loved their culture and adopted it as their own. Even today the majority of poor whites who the black community thinks are racist invite black culture with open arms. It’s the elite white people who look down upon not just blacks but all people who live in poverty. But that is still no reason to hate each other. We must treat each other with respect no matter how we get treated in return. We need to have a culture of trust in Gods plan and obey His command. His command to love Him and our neighbors. We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and kill evil doings by doing good to each other. God has promised us an inheritance of His Kingdom. Don’t throw it away out of hatred towards one another.

I fell for that once, twice, now I know better, and so I am not loyal to any “side,” but the people, most of whom I believe are inherently GOOD. Unfortunately, Biden, his puppeteers, and Trump, are the perfect example of what’s wrong with our society , our “rulers” are as removed from US as they can be and are delusional about their own self importance . These elites don’t actually represent us, none of them. Also, I hope you’ll reconsider calling people “Trump supporters” just because they don’t trust or believe our current president is lucid or capable of doing his job, those things aren’t mutually exclusive. It’s not an insult anyways, I know lots of Trump supporters, they’re not bad or stupid people, they’re just brainwashed and confused like you are. You are two sides of the same coin.

They don't care about you, and they certainly don't care about the people of the Ukraine. It's a farce to give money to the war industry. We didn't give all that money to get Ukrainians to safety, in fact, the west has sabotaged every chance at peace talks.

10129,"""Nice spider""? So, watching animals kill each other is ""beautiful""? What does ""natural"" even mean? It is Scientifically Proven that the Earth is an Irregular Plane (Irregular refers to the Lands, which have elevation and deviation. Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level), which is created because of Intent, Intelligent Design. If you want to watch a quick video to sum all this up, it's explained phenomenally by a Scientist (Realist) known as Del: https://youtu.be/TXWAMyLb-xs and also: https://youtu.be/pKYywPYJfWo

Here's why:

First of all, remember that Science DOES NOT belong to any institution. It DOES NOT belong to a particular group or person. It belongs to every single human being alive.
The ones searching for truths according to the type of the claim become Scientists. People searching for truths also become Realists (Truth Seekers). Science means exploring the inner and outer surroundings of ourselves.

There are three different types of Sciences:
A) Natural Science
B) Formal Science
C) Social Science

Social Science deals with people and their behaviours. Formal Science deals with Mathematics and it's assumptions (Mathematics is a language, which means that we can create anything and make it mathematically correct, but that means NOTHING in real life), Natural Science deals with Objective Reality (The immediate or physical reality). If someone claims that something exists in the Objective World, OTRMDPPs are needed for that claim to be Scientifically Proven. OTRMDPPs means Observable, Testable, Repeatable, Measurable, Demonstrable, Practical Proofs which MUST be verifiable by every single human being alive. Without OTRMDPPs, the claimed thing is considered pseudoscience, or a belief.

I now shall ask the question ""What is the shape of the earth we stand upon?"" and then immediately proceed to look for OTRMDPPs. I found out that some lands are elevated (Mountains), some lands are deviated, some lands are level. We can then conclude that the lands are Irregular in shape, which means not all lands are elevated, not all lands are deviated.

The next OTRMDPP is Water. Water is abundant. It is the second most important thing for human beings to survive (number one being air), which means that every single human being alive has access to it. The bodies of water are largely found in Oceans. I then found out that the bodies of water need a container to stay still (stand). If there isn't a container, I found out that they will flow until they find the lowest point to stand upon. Bodies of water stand, if there is a container, which means we can call them Standing Bodies of Water. I then found out that Standing Bodies of Water are always Level (Which means no elevation or deviation from the starting point to the end). If not messed with in any way (for example the air pushing the water), Standing Bodies of Water are also perfectly still.

I then tried to pour some water in a completely sealed rectangle shaped container, this did the trick. The water then starting to fill up the container until the very top. If I pour any more water, it will flow away.

I then measured it to see if it was perfectly level, and to my surprise, it was perfectly level without any deviation or elevation. Obviously water is the MOST perfect tool we got to make something level. Water takes the shape of a container.

I then got an idea to use a sphere. I started to pour the water onto the sphere, but then the water flowed off from the sphere immediately to the lowest point, that tells me that Water DOES NOT conform to exterior of shapes.

There is also ANOTHER OTRMDPP. The floor cannot rise to our eye level if it were a ball, no matter the size. Because spherical geometry makes it impossible for floor on a ball to rise to our eye level. Watch this video for more info: https://youtu.be/o3jX96TVy5s

With the help of OTRMDPPs, I have concluded that the Earth is an Irregular Plane (Irregular refers to the Lands, which have elevation and deviation. Plane refers to the Standing Bodies of Water, which are always level).

I will then ask another question ""Did something create this world?"". After searching for OTRMDPPs, I found that anything, be it dirt, or water, or rock, can't be created from thin air, stuff cannot pop out of thin air, not even randomly. With the help of OTRMDPPs, it is Scientifically Proven that this world has been created by Intelligent Design. There is absolutely no other option. This world, the entirety of it, is infinite. Because if there's a starting point and an end point, what created the starting point and end point? Then what created the one which created the starting point and end point? Where is it located? It's infinite regress. Only logical solution is infinite. Sure, our lives, the physical world may have a certian finite feature, but the whole thing, the primer mover, has got to be infinite, eternal. Watch this video for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/P3-1GrBTTdo

Now I had some curious questions, ""What about the sky? What about the two light things that move in the sky? What about stars that move in the sky at night?""

Before we go any further, I want you to remember about two more different things when it comes to the Objective World, the Intangible and the Tangible.

Intangibles are those objects which are not in our immediate reality. For example, If I see a house far away, I cannot measure how far away it is or how big it is, I need to get near it first.

Tangibles are those objects which are available in our immediate reality. For example, I am typing this article on my iPad, which means that I can touch it, I can observe it in full 3D. I can rotate it around completely to touch and see the whole shape, I can measure it, I can also interact with it.

The sky is Intangible. The Moon is Intangible. The Sun is Intangible. The Stars are Intangible. OTRMDPPs are NOT available. Every single capable human being should be able to reach the sky and OTRMD with Practical Proofs the things in the sky in full 3D, if not, we do not know what those objects are in the sky, and trying to come up with ideas about what those might be are nothing but assumptions, ideas, beliefs. We live ON Earth, not IN the sky.

Now, OTRMDPPs tell us that because this world contains Air Pressure, there is no other way, this world is CONTAINED. OTRMDPPs tell us that this world is CONTAINED in SOME way, we do not know the shape of the container. But without a solid container, Air Pressure is literally impossible, I'm afraid.

TV Screens, hearsay, white coat guys talking nonsensical mathematical equations are NOTHING but beliefs and mental thoughts, TV Screens are NEVER going to be concluded as Scientific Proofs, the things shown in the TV Screens are NOT PHYSICAL.

Last but not the least, one last question ""Why are things falling downwards?"" Well, the way things fall has NOTHING to do with the shape of the earth. ""But Gravity!"" What is ""Gravity""? Can we OTRMD with Practical Proofs? NO. Is it a magical pulling force which allows some things to fly and pulls down some things to make them fall? Can two objects come closer without some sort of push? ""Yes, in space"" ARE YOU THIS STUPID? We live right NOW, on EARTH, not in some magical fantasy land! In order for two objects to come closer, I either have to push one object to the other from the front, or push the second object from it's back to the front. Motion is ONLY created if something presses on something else. Pull is just a term for push. Things that weigh more than air fall down, things that weigh less than air float.

If you want to go deeper and ask why do things even have weight, we have to first explore the whole earth to get a good understanding. But if you're curious anyway, I suggest you watch this video: https://youtu.be/G05dl2BenKE and this: https://youtu.be/XJ11coI7mas

""Why does it matter? I don't care about the shape!"" Well, I will address you some important questions, ""If the Earth is an Irregular Plane, why are these governments lying?"" They're lying because they don't want people to explore the world and find out what's out there. ""Don't you want to know about your existence, the purpose of life?"", they gave us a 2D map, they're showing the map everywhere, and people are accepting the map WITHOUT exploring the world! How can we verify or falsify a map without physically exploring first? We are trusting governments as if those corrupted psychopaths are our mom and dads! Do you like being imposed by strangers? All the governments are CONNECTED.

If we have the truths about our existence, about what created this, about the whole place, we do NOT need religions, philosophies, beliefs. The majority of people are in debts, some are poor, and some are incredibly and suspiciously rich... then HOW IS THIS A GOOD SYSTEM? The government is imposing it's subjective version of what's good and what's bad on the whole world and people are accepting it? You don't want equality, compassion, love, respect? If a person kidnapped ten people and he's forcing them to do things with or without their consent, he automatically becomes a criminal. What's the government doing? BOTH ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING, IMPOSING! THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION HAS STOCKHOLM SYNDROME!

Thank you for reading this article. If you still have any doubts, please feel free to email me at ‪MysteriousPlane@pm.me‬. Please remember that personalities have nothing to do with Objective Reality.

I'm not associated with anyone, I can only represent myself.

We should not judge people by their personalities unless that's your game. I don't judge people by their personalities (His voice is a bit weird, his hands are tiny! His face is ugly! He is fat!

Other carnivorous mammals don't: cats will play with rodents and other small animals they catch because they are honing their hunting skills.

Even then, what they can't eat, they will try to cache for later, when food might not so be readily available. I don't count creatures such as invertebrates (with the exception of cephalopods, whose intelligence has yet to be fully explored), fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, as they tend to live purely by instinct.

People mature and she wasn't the cheating one to begin with, let alone that your likeliness to cheat is very dependent on where you are in life and on the person you are with. Love is complicated and old(er) age has allowed me to see more nuances in it. What seemed wrong when I was young has become more grey area now.",4,5,621,115,1,4,-2.0

Only solution is to not watch clickbait titles and go for aptly named things but it's called click bait for a reason cus we're all dumb joy-starved frenzied consumers that will just click on the most woosh bang title we see in order to satisfy the addiction of opening up YouTube.. it's a perfect addictive trap sink hole of time wastage and getting annoyed that one of the spikes going through you is not how you would like spikes to be made, is really the least of your worries.

I'll say that again, if you're opening up YouTube with the barely preplanned desire to watch something but you don't know exactly what, you're addicted. You will not just close YouTube as it is a heinous waste of time, you will watch at least one thing to get the reward chemical released for the effort and stress of opening the app and wondering what might be there and if it'll be any good and what are the comments like etc and worse is you watch 2, 3 ,4 5 videos before you're satisfied or worst is if you're like me and have become numb and once you open YouTube you can just keep going and going for hours and hours a day... then you're literally in need of a kind of YouTube rehab. Try not opening it up unless you have a specific topic/video in mind that you wanna research.

It's rather awkward how a popular group that does well in the music industry can't sing (yet pretends to be able to).
I mean, you're not a DJ or anything.

You can't even properly write sentences.
--

People usually say ''He's so succesful -- I'm jealous.''
I'm really not.

I'd rather be me and in the middle of the middle class than be rich and an uneducated fake.
I'm true to myself, and it doesn't seem like you or even most people are.

Just throw everything you have at the wall and see what sticks rather than do what you're meant to do in life, huh?
