20896,"My name has ""girl"" in it and yet I am referred to as a male until I point it out"
20897,"Mine has a woman's name, but people do assume I'm male. Actually, I kind of like it."

20928,"Equally as confusing, my username references several men and I'm a woman"
20929,And I'm a straight guy from Nebraska.
20930,"Wait, are you all saying that our usernames don't have to be something true about ourselves?"
20936,"Only French speakers can guess (?) that I'm female. Most of the time, I'm a ""dude"" or whatever."
20941,Hello there my man how do you do

20945,M'lady

20950,I was really into Indiana Jones when I got mine
20951,Lol that seems about right
20954,People assume I'm a dude all the time because of my user name.

20973,are you male then?
20982,"relax, dude."
20983,So far you are the 4th person to make this joke I wish somebody would be original ;)
21008,I never look at usernames unless it's brought up by another user.
21009,good rule but you miss out on cool names
21012,I'm not sure about others but I don't usually read usernames.
21013,odd man out
21014,So it would seem...
21015,I feel like you have many layers but maybe you don't want to share them
21016,"They say us onions are like ogres, we have layers."
21017,And if you have an odd number there's an odd one out or it's just a twister game
21019,Do onions make you cry?
21022,"okay dude, I'll try not to do that."
21035,Mine has Chick in it. NO one bothers to see that part.

21065,"Well, on average, they are."
21069,I literally posted my NUDES on Reddit and still get referred to as a guy. There's no winning
21071,Everyone on the internet has a penis. Everyone. They mail one to you if you don't have one.

44874,I love meeting a fellow Joey. We should start a club tbh.
44875,I was about to create a subreddit but you can't do that via the rif-app.
44876,"We'll have our subreddit in spirit. Just you, me, and all the others Joeys out there"
44879,Stop what you're doing and take a minute to appreciate being able to breathe freely through your non-congested nasal passages.
44880,Nope I have a cold
44881,Joke's on OP
44882,Why are you on reddit right now?
44883,9:09am I'm just putting off cleaning my room tbh

44889,Just hanging out finishing up this tea and hen having some leftover Indian food after.

44893,Can't sleep... Got any un-popular opinions? Let's hear em!

44901,Chocolate Ice cream is gross.
44902,I had diarrhea the first day/night of my honeymoon
44903,Tl;Dr You had a squirt gun fight with a toilet in Japan
44905,"Wow, pretty lucky for an unlucky situation! Congrats on the marriage, btw!"
44906,"Thanks so much! We are both late 20s, so it took longer than expected, but she's worth the wait."
44910,What's the point of marriage if you can't even tell your wife you have diarrhea?
44911,I think my friends have forgotten my birthday :(
44912,"Happy Birthday! I wish everybody would forget my birthday, I hate my birthday!"
44913,Let's switch bodies

44930,wow number 4 made my heart warm
44931,"Me and my best friend have developed the habit of saying ""Love you bro"" at the end of calls"
44932,"Never stop doing this. Signed, a bro who never hear his best bro's voice again."
44933,"Those of you who put ""No Crazy Bitches"" on your dating profiles: please just quit it. Slight rant."
44934,Why though? It's a good way to weed out assholes
44935,My pet tortoise is too rambunctious.
44936,Has she ever bitten you? If so how much did it hurt?
44937,I came out and it feels good
44938,Good for YOU!!!
44939,"Today I overheard two women conversing on the subway. At one point, one of them legit turned to her friend (whose name was Becky) and exclaimed ""Oh my God, Becky!"" and it literally made my day."
44940,Did anyone around have a nice butt?
44941,Hell yeah! Or so I've been told....
44943,"OP, do you have a big butt? Don't lie..."
44945,This refers to a song?
44946,"My new boss has a first grader that comes to my office after school. Apparently this little guy liked me, and he lets me know about all the gossip about me."
44947,1 st grader are fucking stupid as shit
44948,Sometimes I eat pizza with a knife and fork
44949,"I don't use for and knife, but I have been yelled at (?) for using ranch on my pizza"
44950,I am currently up at 2:28 in the morning- let's talk!
44951,Which country are you located?
44952,Le U.S. in New Jersey :D
44953,"Dear America, stop putting laugh tracks in your shows."
44954,"Oh, finally. I thought I was the only one who found them annoying."
44956,I know right? Big Bang Theory is the worst for them. They practically say them every other line.
44969,Fawlty Towers
44972,Mr Bean
44973,My life
44974,*Hahahahahaa* *Snort*
44980,"As an American, I couldn't agree with you more. It's so incredibly annoying."
44981,*basic laugh track plays*
44982,thank god now i know it's okay to laugh at that
44992,Bazinga!
44994,Good comedy shows don't need them. Just look at The Office or Brooklin 99.
44995,Was just about to say this. Parks and Rec as well.
44996,"If I'm not mistaken, they're all produced/written by the same people right?"
44999,They're all by Michael Schur (also The Good Place)
45010,I also believe the ranch is the same.
45011,"No, the last season the ranch added laugh tracks. So annoying."
45030,Or Malcolm in the middle.
45036,Does this mean That 70's Show isn't good? *cries*
45045,Ah yes a classic sitcom elitist. Go fuck yourself Mr Spell
45046,How rude Mr. Flex Tape San
45047,Rudeness is a necessary evil young Sir Spell. Only to be used when it's absolutely needed
45049,"In all fairness, The IT Crowd also has an annoying laugh track."
45050,But wasn't it filmed in front of a live audience? I think that's a little different
45051,"Well, so were Friends and TBBT, doesn't stop it feeling out of place."
45052,It doesn't seem that out of place for Friends. The laugh track has a antiquated 90's feel to it
45053,It seems out of place for a show that is not in the least bit funny. See: Big Bang Theory
45065,"Fawlty Towers, Black Books too I think"
45069,"""Ok."" - America"
45075,u/voltex49 hate you for pointing out laugh tracks. Guess were even with my subtitles.
45076,Today is my one year anniversary of no soda!!
45077,Awesome! What differences do you notice?
45078,"I've lost around 50lbs! Although that's a combination of no soda, illness, and working out"
45080,Was going to say celebrate it with soda but I guess that's a bad idea right

45098,I'm at work. There's no customers. How are you guys spending your Sunday morning?
45099,Just got off work. Killing time waiting for my car windows to defrost
45100,"I was super drunk last night and texted one of my favorite co-workers ""i love frog"""
45102,"Gonna cross post here now, shouldve realized this was a thing. Thank you!!"

48888,"According to his movies, he might deserve them...but he's not allowed to keep them."
48890,It's just starting to feel like people are worshiping him
48891,"He's worthy, it's fine"
48894,I'm out of the loop. Why is he being mentioned so much lately?

44954,The laugh tracks are the least of tbbt's problems tbh
44956,Better than seeing dead people
44957,Big Bang Theory isn't funny without the laugh track.
44958,Have you ever watched edited videos of bbt without laugh track? It's way worse
44959,The Big Bang Theory is basic and mainstream. Try watching better content.
44960,BBT films in front of a live audience. It's not a laugh track.
44961,are you a time-traveler?
44962,"Well, that's your problem. Stop watching the Big Bang theory."
44963,That's because The Big Bang Theory is garbage. Only bad comedies use laugh tracks.
44964,Why are you watching the Big Bang theory??
44965,TIL The Big Bang Theory represents American tv. God truly has left us
44967,TBH not very much.
44969,"Dont know what you're getting downvoted, you at least acknowledged your mistake..."
44974,*Oooooooohhh* *(applause)*
44975,Mr Bean without laughs.. Not sure I could handle this level of awkwardness
44976,The IT Crowd
44978,Or Flowery Twats.
44982,*laughter fades but one bastard has to keep fake laughing for attention*
44983,"""Should we...laugh harder?"""
44984,Oh shit this ones extra funny! I can tell now.
44985,Apparently all the people you hear on laugh tracks are all dead. So laugh lightly.
44987,Hah HAH HAHAHA haha HAHAHAH. hah...
44989,*followed by a Wilhelm scream*
44992,*My mom laughing*
44999,Don't you put that evil on us!
45000,where did you hear that?
45004,Mose from The Office!!! That shit is crazy
45005,Good old Mose
45007,Assistant **to** the regional manager.
45011,I haven't seen the show but it sounds like they got that idea from the Buffy episode 'The Body'
45012,Another good one: Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
45013,Modern Family?
45014,30 Rock.

45022,Always Sunny
45023,Literally only three responses mentioned iasip man.
45025,My man. I'm glad I picked the name I did lol
45026,Genuinely my favorite show of all time. Scandalized I had to scroll this far!
45027,Their last couple of seasons though... woof!!
45030,Malcolm is criminally underrated. Should be talked about as being up there with the rest.
45031,Best
45032,"Yes, No, maybe? I don't know! Can you repeat the question?"
45034,How HIMYM
45036,"No, Scrubs only had a laugh track for one episode (a ""what if this were a sitcom"" episode)"
45038,"Hahahah, I reccomended B99 to my friends, The Office fans just saying that"
45040,;It's literally in every single one of your shows that I've ever seen. So you are a liar?
45042,God its just so boring I don't think I've ever watched it without being put to sleep
45047,Thank you Sir Spell. I shall bow to you for an eternity
45053,That's because you were young enough to be amused by it.
45054,"I only recently watched it for the first time, still amazing"
45056,Oof Will and Grace did not age well at all.
45057,"Pretty sure most shows with a ""laugh track"" are filmed in front of a live studio audience."
45058,It's the same thing.
45059,They shot some episodes of a recent season of red dwarf without a laugh track.. it didn't work
45061,Rewatching it currently and wow does it kill the pacing
45062,It's an actual real audience watching it being filmed though (for the most part) at least.
45065,Motherland doesn't have one
45067,Father Ted is really the nail in this argument's coffin.
45069,"""Funny. I don't think about you at all."""
45070,"""Couldn't hear you over my diesel truck, two guns, and my buddy shotgunning a beer."""
45071,It's hard to hear it over the laugh track!
45072,"I'm sorry, could you repeat that in the form of a moon landing?"
45073,America always flexin the airpods
45075,Oh. Wasn't sure lol
45086,Unfortunately.
45088,You just changed my life. Thank you.
45091,"Yes. I went 30 days a couple of years ago, but I relapsed and my addiction got even worse."
45095,Neither do I. No worries :)
45097,Probably more when it goes in conjunction with the characters I make up who does the singing.
45099,I'm a nurse
45102,Time to breath some life back into it then!
45104,I hear that about Sweden and a lot of Americans confuse the two.
45105,You're thinking of Swedish people. You just got the stereotype of non Europeans.
45106,Bill Burr bit
45108,Maybe ;)
45111,Hahahaha it's my favorite Swiss stereotype.
45113,WALL!
45115,Jaja si
